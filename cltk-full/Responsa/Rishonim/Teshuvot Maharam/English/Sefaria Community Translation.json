It is permitted to be lenient when a precedent of strictness has been set in error, except with regard to Samaritans, who are wont to take advantage; a fortiori it is permitted to be strict when a precedent of leniency has been set in error.\" So wrote Rabbenu Tam.

                "0": "And you asked about Reuven and Shimon who were captured, and Reuven was rich but Shimon was poor. So Reuven put up the expenses to send messengers to his mother to have them released from the house of captivity. And now Reuven is making a claim against Shimon, that he should give [him] his share of the expenses; and he says that he spent the money [for both of them] according to what [Shimon] said and at his request. Whereas Shimon responds that he did not say anything to him. And I was already asked about this case in Magdeburg. And I was also asked about a teacher who was captured based on empty accusations. He had a deposit with his employer, but commanded the employer not to redeem him. And I wrote to them that we redeem him [even] against his will. And I brought a proof from that [case] in the chapter [entitled] Naarah (Ketuvot 48) of one who says that if he dies, they should not bury him from his assets - we do not listen to him. For there can be no such thing, that he enriches his sons and places his [needs] on the community. And there is another proof from the first chapter of Kiddushin (18a): We redeem [a daughter] against the will of [her father], due to the blemish to the family. And it asks, \"If so, one should force the family of a Hebrew slave also, due to the blemish to the family.\" But it is answered, etc. And since we force the father to redeem his daughter, all the more so do we force him to redeem himself, even when he stands and cries out, \"Do not redeem me!\" And all the more so here, where he did not say anything. And I also brought another proof from the chapter [entitled] Metziat HaEshah (Ketuvot 67b): If he has [sufficient funds], but does not want to support himself, we give him [aid] as a gift, and then they go back and collect [it] from him. And it asks, \"He subsequently would not take it!?!\" Rav Pappa answers, \"[They collect it] after his death.\" Hence if there were not a concern that he subsequently would not take it, we would take it during his lifetime. As we are not concerned about [another] kidnapping, since it does not happen every day, like sustenance [which does]. For since we force him for sustenance - even though there is no danger but he would rather only torment himself and live a difficult life of austerity - all the more so [would we do this] to release him from the hands of the idolaters, that he should not be swallowed among them, that they should not kill him or afflict him with injuries that have no end, which is worse than death (Ketuvot 33a). And perhaps from the afflictions, he will assent to [their religion]. And it is not similar to a river pulling in his donkey and the donkey of his friend, when he leaves his donkey and saves his friend's, where he gets nothing besides his wage [for doing so] (Bava Kamma 115a). And likewise [the case] of one who neglected [work worth] a <i>sela</i>, etc. (from Bava Metzia 30b), since he needed to stipulate [that he would only return a lost object if he would be paid at that rate]. But here, what could he tell him? Even if he would yell out and say, \"Don't redeem me,\" we don't listen to him, but redeem him against his will. Hence we do not need his consent. So the decision is that he needs to give his share of the money [expended]. And there is another proof from its saying in Bava Batra (8a), [that] the people of a city force each other to make a wall, double doors, and a crossbar and even [to hire] a horseman and a guard. And this is even from orphans, for [it is so with] anything from which orphans have protection. Even though there are many others there, if [the orphans] would not also [pay], they would pay much [more] than now. [And] it is not relevant in this case to force [the others to pay more] on account of their being like Sodom. And there is a great reason here: For if we did not force everyone, each one would say, \"I don't need to\"; and would think, \"My fellows will do it without my money. And as a result of this, the matter would be pushed off and they would come to a danger. That is why the Rabbis were stringent about these things and those like them. In short, it appears that this is like [a simple question about the permissibility of eating] an egg with <i>cutacha</i> (a dairy food). It is simple that he needs to give his share, and that we calculate [it] based on [their] money, not on souls, since they were only captured for the sake of money. And it should not at all be compared to one who pays [another's] debt (Nedarim 33b) [in which case the debtor is not obligated to pay him], since he is only 'chasing away a lion' from his property, even when it is with a forceful creditor, as it is found in the Yerushalmi (Nedarim). For there he is [only] saving him from distress, but not from a loss, as it is explained, since the law is that the debtor must [eventually] pay the creditor [regardless]. But where he saves him from a loss, he would not be [only] 'chasing away a lion.' And here he is saving him from a loss, since the thieves did not seize him according to the law. And [this is true] even according to the second understanding, as explained by RI - that this is why one who pays [another's] debt is 'chasing away a lion':  That he could say, \"I have friends who have mercy upon me and they will pay this debt for me, to save me from distress.\" [For] that is the case with a debt, when he is obligated to pay by the law, but not with theft. And there is a proof of the matter from the decision of the Light of the Exile (Rabbenu Gershom) from a certain extortionist who extorted a horse from a Jewish home, etc., and which is brought in Tosafot on Bava Kama 58a. As he extorted the horse from the home and sold it to a fellow Jew, but [R. Gershom] did not obligate [that Jew] to return it for free to the Jew from which it was stolen (so the latter must rather pay for it). And this is how RI decided [as well]. And it is not at all similar to a debt that he owes to a Jew. For even if he did not pay it, the damage would not be clear. However if one came into the hands of thieves, there are no limits, [but is rather] 'like an antelope in a net.' And one who is alacritous to release him is surely praiseworthy, and then takes from him that which he benefited him (the ransom). And it should not be said [that] perhaps the capturers will release him for free in the end, since we do not follow a doubt when it comes to lives, but rather redeem him against his will. And the matter is known that anyone who comes to the hands of brigands does not come out complete in his body and complete in his money (without injury to one or the other).  "
