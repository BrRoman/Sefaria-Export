            "And Abaye resolves: The Torah only prohibited making objects that resemble items which can be replicated by humans. As it was taught in a Baraita: “One should not make a house in the likeness of the Sanctuary (Heichal), forty cubits in length and twenty cubits in width, nor an entryway resembling the Ulam [Temple Hall],” etc. However, objects like the sun, the moon, and similar items, which a human cannot replicate, are not prohibited by the Torah. But then we raise an objection: Really? Wasn’t it taught in another Baraita: \"Do not make with Me\"—this teaches that you shall not make in the likeness of My servants who serve before Me in the heavens? We counter: The Torah only prohibits making the likeness of the four faces together (like the four faces of the Heavenly Chariot).Then we question: If that’s the case, would making the face of a human alone be permitted? Why then does another Baraita teach that all facial images are permitted except for the human face? Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, explains: He (the other authority) was not aware of the interpretation of “Do not make with Me”—“Do not make images of Me.” However, other items are permitted. But again, didn’t we learn in a Baraita: \"Do not make in the likeness of My servants who serve before Me in the heavens,\" including beings like the Ophanim (celestial beings)? To this we respond: The case of Rabban Gamliel, who used certain images, is different because others made them for him. Still, is that the case? Rav Yehuda had others make for him a ring bearing an image, to use as a seal. And Shmuel said to him, “Sharp one, erase its appearance”—meaning, remove its image. And we resolve: In Rav Yehuda’s case, his seal was embossed, meaning it stood out and was raised, which could lead to suspicion, as it was taught in a Baraita: \"A ring with a raised seal may not be worn on one’s finger, but it is permitted to use it for sealing. A ring with an indented seal may be worn, but it is forbidden to use it for sealing.\""
