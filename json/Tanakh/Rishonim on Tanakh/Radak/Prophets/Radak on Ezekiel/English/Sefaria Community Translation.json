When they see even one bone, as they pass through the land, they shall build a marker from stones next to it until the fixed men who would do the burying would [reach] it. This is because, among this and the other, the bone would get covered by something before the buriers would get to it. So when they would see the marker, they would know that there is a bone there, then they would take it from there and bury it in the Valley of Gog’s Multitude. For they will bring all of them there, and they will bury them there so that the land will not be full of [the bones]. Rather, they will be gathered and buried in one place, and they will be a memorial for the days to come afterward about what God, may He be blessed, did in [the land]. And the marker will be from one stone or several stones brought together.</i></i>"
