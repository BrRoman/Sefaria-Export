        "19_Chapter, 19_Verse, 0_Paragraph": "This comes to warn about the cherubim, etc. For if not so, why do I need [the phrase] \"gods of silver\"?  And if you say, why does it interpret \"Do not make with Me\" as 'Do not make the form of My servants', and we do not interpret \"Do not make with Me gods of silver\" literally, about the cherubim, that if one altered them to make them of silver, behold, they would be like gods of silver.  and there is to say, if so, why is it written further \"Do not make for yourselves\", it should have written \"Do not make with Me gods of silver and gods of gold\", and from the fact that it is further written \"Do not make\", we learn from here that the beginning of the verse refers to another matter, not to the cherubim. And that which it needed to say 'about the cherubim that you make to stand with Me', even though the word \"with Me\" written in the verse refers to the servants that serve on high, this is because \"gods of silver\" is written without a vav, and it should have written 'and gods of silver', rather, by necessity, the word \"with Me\" in the verse is also connected below, and it wants to say, 'Do not make with Me the form of My servants', also \"with Me\", which are the cherubim, do not make them of silver. This is how it is in the commentary of the Ra'am. And that which it says further \"Do not make for yourselves\", it comes to warn not to make cherubim in synagogues, he derives it from the extra \"for yourselves\" according to this, and not from \"Do not make\", for if not for \"Do not make\", I would say the beginning of the verse \"Do not make with Me\" refers to the servants as mentioned above, rather, he expounds the extra \"for yourselves\" that they should not make cherubim in synagogues."
