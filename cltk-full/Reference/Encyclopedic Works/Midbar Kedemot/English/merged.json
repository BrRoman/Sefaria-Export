Accordingly, the words <i>Abram, \"Surely go\" [<i>Avram, \"Lekh lekhah</i>\"] (Genesis 12:1) is the numerical equivalent [<i>gematria</i>] of rain  [<i>geshem</i>]. Just like rain is enclosed in the clouds, and no one knows its nature, but when it falls to the earth, everyone benefits from it; so too [Abraham's] nature did not go out into the world when he was in his [previous] place. And just like rain brings blessing to the world, so too you — <i>and you shall be a blessing</i> (Genesis 12:2). And Rabbenu Ephraim also wrote at length [about this] in his commentary. And it is possible even to say that Avraham is the numerical equivalent of precipitation [<i>matar</i>] when being inclusive [adding the word itself to the count, a tool used when the equivalent is off by one].</i>"
