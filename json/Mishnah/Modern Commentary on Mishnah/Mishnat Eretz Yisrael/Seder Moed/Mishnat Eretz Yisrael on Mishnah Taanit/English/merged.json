                    "<b>On the seventeenth of Tamuz, the Tablets were broken</b> by Moshe on account of the Jewish people's sin with the calf. In both Talmuds and in other Talmudic sources, they sketched out the order of events after the giving of the Torah and came to the date of the seventeenth of Tamuz. It was the day that Moshe came down from the mountain, when he saw the calf and broke the tablets: The Torah was given on the sixth or seventh of Sivan. According to the opinion of the rabbis who say the Torah was given on the sixth of Sivan, Moshe went up the mountain the next day; whereas according to the opinion of those who say that the Torah was given on the seventh, he went up it on the same day. Moshe stayed forty days on the mountain, as stated in the Torah (Exodus 24:18). He came down, however, on the seventeenth of Tamuz with the two tablets; but when he saw the people sinning with the calf, which they had made for themselves in order to worship, he flung down the tablets and broke them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">294</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Yerushalmi Taanit 68c; Bavli Taanit 28b; Seder Olam Rabba 6, pp. 25-6; Tanchuma, Nasso 31.</i>"
