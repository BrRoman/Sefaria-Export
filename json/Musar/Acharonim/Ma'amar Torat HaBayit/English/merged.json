            "Blessed be the Lord Gd of Heaven who has chosen us as His portion and given us his holy Torah which is noble from the heavens above. And when we have the privilege of connecting to it (The Torah) during our lifetime and keeping its laws and commandments, we will live and exist forever like IT (The Torah), and like it was written (Leviticus 18,5) \"and you kept my laws and my judgments, which a person will make and live by them, and Unclus translated [וחי בהן] (and he lived by them)means to say [ בחיי עלמא] in the life of Alma [for he says, if the intent was in this world , at the end he dies,like Rashi explained Leviticus 18,5]."
