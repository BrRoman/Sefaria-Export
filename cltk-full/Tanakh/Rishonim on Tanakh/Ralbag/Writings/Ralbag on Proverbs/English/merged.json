                "0": "Truth. Behold, attaining truth is something to be acquired, and although it is something transient (hava), from this perspective, it is not subject to loss, as the philosopher thought about all things transientâ€”that they are bound to perish. However, the knowledge and acquisition you attain in any wisdom, in political philosophy, and in divine wisdom (which is called understanding), cannot be taken away or removed from you. For acquired intellect is eternal, as we have mentioned. It has already been clarified that it is impossible for a person to forget intellectual attainment, as explained in the first discourse of Sefer Mevo HaYediah (Introduction to Knowledge) and in its commentary on Sefer HaNefesh (The Book of the Soul)."
