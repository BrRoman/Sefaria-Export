            "Tosafos in the passage starting with \"Come and Hear: The one who finds money, etc.\" writes: \"Even though there is a sign (to identify the money), since the reasoning is established that the majority [are present there, etc.].\" And according to Rava, who agrees regarding something that has a sign, this is not difficult for him. Since here, because the majority are commonly present, the person would likely despair of recovering it, as if it had no sign. But for Abaye, this is difficult, because ultimately the despair would be unintentional, and it is reasonable for him to raise this difficulty, as the case is dealing with something that has a sign. Investigate this well."
