There once was a king, who had a servant who was able to play the harp with the utmost beauty. One tune, in particular, was most pleasing in the eyes of the king, and he instructed the musician to play it before him in the palace every day - even several times a day. And so it was. After some time, the tune seemed old to the musician, and he lost the passion and arousal that had previously burned within him. What did the king do to restore this arousal and emotional desire in the musician? Each and every time he wanted to hear his favourite tune, he would summon a person from the marketplace who had never heard the tune played before. Since this newcomer had just arrived, it rekindled passion in the musician! And so it was for many days. After time, however, the king took advice from his counsellors, in order to know what else could be done with the musician, for it was wearisome to summon a new guest each time the tune was to be played, just in order to arouse some passion. The advice they gave was this: order the eyes of the musician to be torn out, so that he be forever blind, never again to see the form of man. Now, any time the king wanted to hear his favourite tune, he would tell the musician that there was a new person in front of him, who has never heard your music before. Thus the passion was reborn each time, since the musician could not make out the form of the person before him, and truly believed that there was a new listener there. And so it was. This is the end of the story. "

For the knowledge and faith that the Master of the World – the Divine life-force – is in every movement and thought, both big and small, immediately causes “the workers of iniquity to be dispersed” (Psalms 92:10). The evil falls away and the Divine light and life-force becomes revealed. The Master of the World can be found even in the sins of a totally wicked person, in one who is burning to sin. The only exception is the sin of idolatry, as it is written: “…one he-goat for a sin-offering,” which lacks the letter <i>aleph</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Representing the <i>Alupho shel </i><i>Olam</i> – the Master of the world.</i><br>A person should think: “How can I make My Creator angry by misusing the very life-force that He gives me, and seeing that He is actually with me? How can I commit this great evil?” One should even partake of permissible desires with a spirit of holiness and humility, and with an awareness of the Divine vitality within them. If you do this, you will easily dispel the evil, and become a different person – a holy person who is bound in love to G-d, who experiences true “love of delights” (Song of Songs 7:7). You will easily attain Divine Inspiration, and the spirit of G-d will guide you.<br>Sometimes, however, [the verse applies]: “Hiding, I will hide My face” (Deuteronomy 31:18). Then, the concealment itself is hidden, and a person does not feel any vitality at all. He knows nothing, and forgets that G-d is with him. This happens because he lost his faith and trust in G-d and turned to false gods. At that moment he is subject to Divine retribution. For so long as a person clings to G-d in perfect faith, no evil can befall him at all – only love and affection.<br><i>Leket Imrei Peninim</i>, p. 206b"
