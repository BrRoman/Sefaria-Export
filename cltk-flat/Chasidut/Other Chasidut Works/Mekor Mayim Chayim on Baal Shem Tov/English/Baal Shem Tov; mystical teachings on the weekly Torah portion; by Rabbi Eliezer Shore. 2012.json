        "53_Vayeilech, 3_Comment, 1_Paragraph": "If a person has complete knowledge and faith that in every concealment and foreign thought G-d’s Presence is hidden, then there is no concealment at all. For the knowledge and faith that the Master of the World – the Divine life-force – is in every movement and thought, both big and small, immediately causes “the workers of iniquity to be dispersed” (Psalms 92:10). The evil falls away and the Divine light and life-force becomes revealed. The Master of the World can be found even in the sins of a totally wicked person, in one who is burning to sin. The only exception is the sin of idolatry, as it is written: “…one he-goat for a sin-offering,” which lacks the letter <i>aleph</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Representing the <i>Alupho shel </i><i>Olam</i> – the Master of the world.</i><br>A person should think: “How can I make My Creator angry by misusing the very life-force that He gives me, and seeing that He is actually with me? How can I commit this great evil?” One should even partake of permissible desires with a spirit of holiness and humility, and with an awareness of the Divine vitality within them. If you do this, you will easily dispel the evil, and become a different person – a holy person who is bound in love to G-d, who experiences true “love of delights” (Song of Songs 7:7). You will easily attain Divine Inspiration, and the spirit of G-d will guide you.<br>Sometimes, however, [the verse applies]: “Hiding, I will hide My face” (Deuteronomy 31:18). Then, the concealment itself is hidden, and a person does not feel any vitality at all. He knows nothing, and forgets that G-d is with him. This happens because he lost his faith and trust in G-d and turned to false gods. At that moment he is subject to Divine retribution. For so long as a person clings to G-d in perfect faith, no evil can befall him at all – only love and affection.<br><i>Leket Imrei Peninim</i>, p. 206b"
