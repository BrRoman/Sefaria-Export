        "29_Daf, 12_Comment": "<b>What</b> is [the meaning of] the queen of Sheba? The kingdom of Sheba: At first glance, this is difficult. Since all of the content that is stated about the queen of Sheba is in the feminine form, until it ends, <i>and she and her attendants left and returned to her land</i> (I Kings 10:13), implying like the straightforward understanding of the verse, that she was a female! And why is it not stated like this about the other kingdoms, [the queen of x] is to mean the kingdom? So it should be explained that this is what it is saying: Anyone who says that the queen of Sheba is a woman who did not reign but rather was the wife of a king, and that is why she was called the queen of Sheba — the explanation of queen being the wife of a king, coming in the way of all the kingdoms — is nothing but mistaken. So what is  [the meaning of] the queen of Sheba? That she is the queen of Sheba on her own and she herself reigns. And even today, there are kingdoms in which a woman reigns there, and it is easy to understand. "
