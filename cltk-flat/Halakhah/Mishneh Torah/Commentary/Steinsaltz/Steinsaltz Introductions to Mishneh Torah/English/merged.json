        "81_Rebels, 0_Paragraph": "The laws of rebels are not of exactly one kind: some of them include commandments and prohibitions related to major general matters concerning the principles of the religion of all Israel, and some of them pertain to personal and familial matters. Indeed, they share a common denominator, in that those 'rebels' defy the frameworks of authority that the Torah has granted importance to, and in cases of extreme rebellion, they are also judged severely, even to the point of the death penalty.",
        "81_Rebels, 1_Paragraph": "The initial laws discussed here pertain to the authority of the Great Court of seventy-one, whose role is to ensure the practical observance of the Torah in every generation. First and foremost, the court is obligated to the commandments of the Torah and is forbidden to annul or add any commandment. However, it does have the authority to enact regulations and impose decrees on the public, as long as these do not carry the weight of Torah commandments. The Great Court is part of the chain of tradition that transmits the study of Torah from generation to generation, and therefore it is somewhat subordinate to the courts that preceded it, although in certain cases it has the authority to annul the rulings of its predecessors.",
        "81_Rebels, 2_Paragraph": "The aspect connected to this matter in the context of the laws of rebels is that if one of the sages of Israel disputes the Great Court and instructs others to act contrary to its rulings, he is classified as a 'rebellious elder' and his punishment is death. This elder's instruction must pertain to something involving the permissibility of severe prohibitions ('whose intentional violation incurs karet and unintentional violation incurs a sin offering'), or something that indirectly causes such a violation, and he either instructs others to act according to his ruling or acts that way himself. Incidentally, the law of the rebellious elder clarifies the status of those who deny the Oral Torah, the heretics, and the apostates, who are not subject to the death penalty by the court because their rebellion is not directed against the framework of the court's authority.",
        "81_Rebels, 3_Paragraph": "The second part of the laws of rebels pertains to the status of parents in relation to their children. The Torah emphasizes the importance of this relationship to the extent that it equates it with the reverence due to the Holy One, blessed be He. Two positive commandments are explained in this context: honoring one's father and mother and fearing one's father and mother, which involve attending to all their needs and demonstrating submissive behavior towards them. On the other hand, there are severe prohibitions, such as the prohibition against injuring one's parents and the prohibition against cursing them. Those who violate these prohibitions are liable to the death penalty.",
        "81_Rebels, 4_Paragraph": "A unique and exceptional law regarding rebellion against parental authority is that of the 'wayward and rebellious son,' a boy who steals from his parents, associates with wrongdoers, and continues his misbehavior even after being warned and disciplined by his parents and the court. The verdict for such a son, if his parents desire it, is pronounced by the court as death, and this sentence is publicly announced throughout Israel. Although it is unclear whether this law was ever actually implemented, its fundamental principle serves to emphasize that a child who rebels against parental authority is likely to commit far more severe crimes and become a danger to society as a whole."
