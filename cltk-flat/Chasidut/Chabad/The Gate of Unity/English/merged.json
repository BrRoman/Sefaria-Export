        "1_, 0_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "We must now clearly explain the matter of contemplation itself, [to understand] what it essentially is, and what one should contemplate.",
        "1_, 0_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "In essence, contemplation (<i>hitbonenut</i>) is the matter of gazing strongly into the depths of a concept, keeping [one’s mind] upon it for long periods, until he understands it thoroughly in all of its particular parts and details.",

        "1_, 0_Chapter, 10_Paragraph": "The length [of a concept] is the tremendous descent of the concept, to invest it into various different analogies so that it may even be brought within the reach of a small child.

        "1_, 0_Chapter, 12_Paragraph": "The waters that are above [the depth], to its height or to its sides and [even] to its length, are secondary to it, for they only represent the spreading forth of its strength.",

        "1_, 0_Chapter, 16_Paragraph": "This then, is [the mode of study] called <i>Iyun</i> (in depth study); that he keeps his mind on the concept and analyzes it greatly. This is [a] slow [in depth study] which is the opposite of [the] quick [surface level of study].",
        "1_, 0_Chapter, 17_Paragraph": "The purpose of this is specifically to reach the depth of the concept, as it is in its innermost essential point.",

        "1_, 0_Chapter, 19_Paragraph": "This [type of study] is called <i>Hitbonenut</i> – contemplation. [The word <i>Hitbonenut</i> (התבו<b>ננ</b>ות) is] specifically spelled with two <i>Nuns</i> (נ – N), to signify that one [is to] contemplate it and analyze it greatly.

As mentioned previously, it is like the waters of a spring in comparison to the waters of a river.",
        "1_, 0_Chapter, 22_Paragraph": "Nonetheless, the aspect of delving in [this] source of the concept, its source reaches into the very source of the flow of the waters of the spring of <i>Chochmah</i>, which is called “the depths of <i>Chochmah</i>” or “the hidden-ness of <i>Chochmah.</i>”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Omkei Chochmah</i> or <i>Ta’alumot Chochmah</i>.

        "1_, 0_Chapter, 23_Paragraph": "The depth of the spring is the beginning and source of its inception, at its very depth. From there its flow spreads upward until drops of water burst forth into revelation from their concealment [within the ground]. Its utmost concealment is in its ultimate depth below (in the aquifer), as [in the verse], “the wellsprings of the abyss burst forth.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Genesis 7:11</i> For, the earth is riddled with fissures<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, tractate Chagiga 22a</i> and veins [of water], which have a primary depth.

        "1_, 0_Chapter, 24_Paragraph": "Now, <i>Chochmah</i> is the discovery of new insight which emerges like a bolt of lightning, as known. [The source of its inception in its hidden depths is its innermost essence. This is similar to the previous explanation of the matter of the depth of the comprehended concept (<i>Omek Ha’Moosag</i>) of <i>Binah</i>.] However, that was only in regard to the depth of the comprehension of <i>Binah</i> which is felt in a tangible way, with revealed explanations [on a subject]. The depth of this explanation of the concept is only the aspect of the “nothing of the something” of comprehension. Therefore, its depth, which is its essential point, is of no comparison to the “nothing” of <i>Chochmah</i> before it comes into the category of comprehension altogether.",
        "1_, 0_Chapter, 25_Paragraph": "Nevertheless, although the depth of the comprehension, which is called the 50th gate of <i>Binah</i>, is drawn from the “nothing” of <i>Chochmah</i> to “something,” (like the teaching,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Talmud Bavli, Yoma 77b</i> “A spring will flow out of the chamber of the Holy of Holies; its beginning will be like the antennae of a grasshopper, and it will then widen into the expanse of a river,” and the like,) its source also reaches into the depths of <i>Chochmah</i> itself. It is clearly observable that the delving specifically into the depth of the comprehension (<i>omek hamoosag</i> of <i>Binah</i>) will bring one to the source and root of the concept, thus enabling him to bring new light of <i>Chochmah</i> (insight) into <i>Binah</i> (tangible comprehension). This, then, is what is called <i>Ma’amik</i> – delving, which is an active verb, for he is activating the depths of <i>Chochmah</i> and <i>Binah.</i>",
        "1_, 0_Chapter, 26_Paragraph": "(According to what we have explained, we may understand the statement,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Sefer Yetzirah 1:4</i> “Understand with wisdom and be wise in understanding.” In [Chassidic] manuscripts it is explained that “wise in understanding” refers to <i>A”b</i> of <i>Sa”G</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The four letters of the Name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה correspond to the ten <i>sefirot</i>.

The first letter <i>Heh</i> (ה) corresponds to how the seminal point of the <i>Yod</i> of <i>Chochmah</i> becomes expanded into the length and width of the <i>Heh</i> of <i>Binah</i>. The <i>Vav</i> (ו) which has a numerical value of six corresponds to the six emotional <i>sefirot</i>. The last <i>Heh</i> (ה) corresponds to <i>Malchut</i>. This will all be explained later in greater detail. What is relevant here is that the four-letter name <i>HaShem</i>-יהו״ה can be expanded. In other words, instead of <i>Y</i> (י) the letter <i>Yod</i> would be spelled out as יוד. The same is done with the other three letters of the name. Now, when it is spelled out with <i>Yod’s</i> (i.e. יו\"ד ה\"י וי\"ו ה\"י) it has a numerical value of 72 and corresponds to <i>Chochmah</i>, which is the name <i>A”b</i> – ע\"ב (meaning 72).

We may now understand the above statement that, “be wise in understanding” refers to <i>A”b</i> of <i>Sa”G</i>. In other words, it refers to the <i>sefirah</i>; <i>Chochmah</i> of <i>Binah</i>. Likewise, the aspect of <i>Sa”G</i> of <i>A”b</i> corresponds to <i>Binah</i> of <i>Chochmah</i>. The Mittler Rebbe will now explain this further.

        "1_, 1_Chapter, 17_Paragraph": "The meaning of “a man of <i>Tvunah</i>” is that he has a thorough grasp of the essential comprehension. Because of this, the comprehension spreads forth in him, to do and to shed light upon many completely separate matters.",

However, these two are how these emotions come into revelation, to the outside. The aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tvunah</i> is the aspect of the intellect which comes in thought, which is called the letters of intellectual thought (<i>Machshevet Sechel</i>), within which the intellect becomes invested. It is the external vessel for analytical thought (<i>Machshava Iyunit</i>), which is the revelation of the comprehension of <i>Binah</i> itself, from the aspect of the essence of the concept and explanation. From the aspect of <i>Malchut</i> of <i>Tvunah</i> is drawn the source of the letters of thought themselves, which is called <i>Leah</i>.

Firstly, these two elements correspond to <i>Chessed –</i> kindness, and <i>Gevurah</i> – might. Secondly, as will be explained later, the actual makeup of the emotions is from these two elements. Thirdly, it is the emotions which influence the speech and action, and therefore, the emotions (<i>Zeir Anpin</i>) are called “heaven” while speech and action (<i>Malchut</i>) which receives from the emotions, is called “earth.”</i>",
