And their measurements for defiling is like that of a lentil (though we are informed in Tractate Kelim, Chapter 17, Mishnah 8, that whenever a lentil is spoken of, it means…the Egyptian lentil). For the sand lizard/חמט at the beginning of its creation is like that of lentil (see Tractate Nazir 52a). But the limbs have no measure, for even less that of a lentil of a reptile defiles (see Tractate Ohalot, Chapter 1, Mishnah 7). And especially when it is moist, the reptile defiles, but it does not defile when dry, as it is written (Leviticus 11:32): “And anything on which one of them falls when dead [shall be impure: be it any article of wood, or a cloth, or a skin, or a sack – any such article that can be put to use shall be dipped in water, and it shall remain impure until evening; then it shall be pure],” similar to their being dead (see Tractate Niddah 56a).",
        "0_Chapter, 0_Mishnah, 1_Comment": "ושכבת זרע – Specifically the semen of an adult Israelite , but that of a heathen does not defile, even according to the Rabbis, for the nocturnal pollution of a heathen is completely pure. And similarly, the semen of a minor also does not defile, as it is written (Leviticus 15:16): “When a man has an emission of semen, [he shall bathe his whole body in water and remain impure until evening],” a man/איש, but not a minor/קטן who is younger than nine-years and one-day old, for [prior to the age of nine-years and one-day] his act of sexual intercourse is not coition. And its measurement to the observer is a little bit, even similar to a mustard seed, and to contact/touching, like that of a lentil. And specifically moist semen that defiles, as it is written (Leviticus 15:16): “[When a man has] an emission of semen/כי תצא ממנו שכבת זרע,” he who is appropriate for emitting semen, for since the teacher of our Mishnah did not consider a בעל קרי/one who experienced a seminal emission (see Leviticus 15:16-18) as one of the primary sources of defilement, we learn from this that it is none other than first degree of ritual defilement, and this is taught at the conclusion of Tractate Zavim (Chapter 5, Mishnah 11), that a person who experienced a seminal emission is like one who came in contact with a reptile, and is not seen as other than first [degree of ritual defilement].",

But utensils/vessels that came in contact with the dead are like the dead itself, and whatever comes in contact with them is made into a primary source of ritual defilement. But utensils/vessels which came in contact with a person who was defiled through contact with the dead or a person who came in contact with utensils/vessels that had been in contact with the dead, they are primary sources of ritual defilement and are defiled for seven days like a person, as is taught in the Mishnah of the first chapter of Ohalot [Mishnah 2]. But earthenware and foods and liquids that came in contact with the dead do not become primary sources of ritual defilement. And especially an Israelite becomes a primary source of ritual defilement when he touched a dead person. But an idolater and similarly a non-viable birth/premature that was born at the age of a month is not susceptible to become ritually impure if he came in contact with the dead.",

All the laws applying to a quarantined leper apply to a confirmed leper – who must grow his hair long and rend his garments; to purify himself when healed, he must shave all his hair, and bring a special purification offering) and who is fitted for Levitical uncleanness with [his bringing] [two] birds, and cedar wood and hyssop and two scarlet-dyed yarn and shaving, and he sits from outside his tent for seven days and one the eighth [day] brings his sacrifices (see Leviticus 14:8), and on those seven days are called the days of his counting, and he defiles humans, and it is stated “the washing of his clothing “ (“The one to be purified shall was his clothing” – Leviticus 14:8) on the day of final decision [by a Kohen] and it is stated, “the washing of his clothes” on the days of his counting (Leviticus 14:9: “[On the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair…]he shall wash his clothes [and bathe his body in water; then he shall be pure],” just as there he defiles a human being, so here [also] he defiles a human being.",

But if it the defilement touched the vessel from the outside, it was not defiled by this contact, as it is written (Leviticus 11:33): “And if any of those (i.e., an article of wood, or a cloth, or a skin, or a sack) falls into an earthen vessel, everything inside it shall be impure [and the vessel itself you shall break],” from inside it/within it, it becomes defiled, but it is not defiled from outside of it.",

        "0_Chapter, 1_Mishnah, 0_Comment": "מטמאים את האדם במשא – when he lifts one of them whether by his hand or his fellow lifts it upon his shoulder, and even if he [himself] did not make contact with the defiling substance, or that the defiling substance was tied with a rope and the defiling agent was lifted via the rope. Since he moved the weight of the impure thing on his own, the person is defiled by ritual impurity imparted by carrying [even when not touching them directly] to defile the clothing that is upon him, or all of the garments/clothing and vessels/utensils that he comes in contact with, except for earthenware, all the while that the defiling matter is upon his back. But after he withdrew from the defilement, he does not defile utensils/vessels through touching/contact, for whomever carries the defilement, after he has withdrawn from it is not ought but first degree of ritual impurity, but utensils/vessels do not become susceptible to receive defilement other than from a primary source of ritual impurity. But even at the time that he carries the defilement, he does not defile humans nor earthenware vessels, but rather only other utensils/vessels. And you do not have something that is defiled with ritual impurity imparted by carrying other than a human being alone, but not utensils/vessels and not food and liquids, for if there were may utensils/vessels one on top of the other and a carrion or the waters of lustration in the upper-most vessel, the lower vessels are not defiled by carrying all the while that they did not touch/come in contact with the carrion or with the waters of lustration. And similarly, food and liquids are not defiled with the ritual impurity imparted by carrying, for concerning the ritual impurity imparted by carrying, it is written \"לכם\" (see Leviticus 11:39: “If an animal that you may eat has died/וכי ימות מן-הבהמה אשר-היא לכם לאכלה [anyone who touches its carcass shall be impure until evening]),” and we expound [the word] \"לכם\"/that you – that they defile through carrying but they do not defile vessels nor foods and liquids through carrying. And just as carrion defiles through carrying, so it also defiles through movement/ היסט (i.e., by means of a lever, without actually coming in contact with it – and this applies to impurity imparted by someone with gonorrhea, a woman in flux, a menstruating woman or a woman after childbirth), for movement is from the category/species of carrying, as for example, that there was wood placed at the tope of a tree or at the top of a wall and a carrion was at one end of the wood and a person comes and puts the knee of the balance down on the second/opposite end, since he lifted the end on which the carrion on is on account of his additional weight, it is defiled with the ritual impurity of movement, which is like carrying.",
        "0_Chapter, 1_Mishnah, 1_Comment": "וחשוכי בגדים במגע (and to make unclean the persons alone but not their clothes) – meaning to say, the clothes are prevented from defilement if there is contact without carrying, for the person who comes in contact/touches the carrion or the waters of lustration but does not carry them does not defile even the clothing that is upon him, as it written (Leviticus 11:39, though this verse, which is brought by the commentary of Rabbi Pinchas Kahati on this Mishnah does NOT exactly express what Bartenura writes – perhaps he is referring to Leviticus 11:27): “anyone who touches its carcass shall be impure until evening” (and see verse 27: “whoever touches their carcasses/הנוגע בנבלתם shall be impure until evening. [They are impure for you/טמאים המה לכם”), and the washing of clothing is not mentioned there, and with the waters of lustration, it is also written (Numbers 19:21 – and this verse does not match the Hebrew text brought by the Bartenura commentary, but is also referred to by the commentary of Rabbi Pinchas Kahati where he mentions that in both places, the washing of clothing is not mentioned: “Whatever that impure person touches shall be impure until evening/והנוגע במי הנדה יטמא עד-הערב”. On the other hand, use of the Bar Ilan Responsa project takes the reader to Numbers 31:24: “On the seventh day you shall wash your clothes and be pure, and after that you may enter the camp.”). [The word] חשוכי – is the language of prevention, like (Genesis 22:16): “Because [you have done this] and have not withheld your son/ולא חשכת את-בנך, [your favored one].”",

Whereas the lower surface below a person with gonorrhea or a woman with a flux or a menstruating woman or a woman after childbirth, even ten couches one on top of the other, and one of these defiled [couches] are above, all of them that are below/the lower surface are impure and defile humans and utensils/vessels.",

        "0_Chapter, 2_Mishnah, 6_Comment": "למעלה מן המרכב משכב – for the stone used for closing a pit that the corpse was put on a closing (immovable) stone defiles lying as it does riding. And more stringent than this is that its coming in contact/touching is equivalent to carrying it to defile a person which defiles his clothing. His coming in contact/touching is explicitly written (Leviticus 15:5): “Anyone who touches his bedding shall wash his clothes, [bathe in water, and remain impure until evening].” And his carrying, that after Scripture mentioned the law of touching by lying and the law of touching by riding it states (Leviticus 15:9-10): “[Any means for riding that one with a discharge has mounted shall be impure; whoever touches anything that was under him shall be impure until evening;] and whoever carries such things shall wash his clothes, [bathe in water, and remain impure until evening],” so we see that regarding lying, whether through contact/touching – whether through carrying, requires the washing of clothing, but concerning riding, Scripture divides between coming in contact with/touching and carrying as it is written (Leviticus 15:9): “Any means for riding that one with a discharge has mounted shall be impure,” whereas that he should wash his clothes, is not written.",

When he comes to the house, everything that is in the house is impure, even though he did not touch it/come in contact with it, as it is written (Leviticus 13:46): “[He shall be impure as long as the disease is upon him. Being impure, he shall dwell apart;] his dwelling shall be outside the camp,” which teaches that is dwelling is impure. From here, they (i.e., the Rabbis) stated that a leper that sits underneath the tree and a pure person passes by, the pure person is defiled. But if a pure person sits underneath the tree and a leper passes by, the pure person is not defiled. And similarly leprous clothing and with a leprous stone. And especially concerning a leper during the days of his receiving final judgment following probationary enclosure, but during the days of his counting, that is, after shaving/cutting off all of his hair and [the offering of] the birds, he does not defile by entering and he does not defile by lying and sitting.",

But even though that the leper is more stringent than a bone the size of a barley corn, for the leper defiles everything that is in the tent when he comes to the tent, but the bone the size of barley corn does not defile in the tent, nevertheless, on this level, however, the bone the size of a barley corn is more stringent as it defiles an uncleanness of seven[days]. And similarly, all of these are of [increasingly] higher levels that are considered not for every matter it is stated that the second is more stringent than the first, for many of them have a stringency in the first [mentioned] that is not [found] in the second, but for that [higher] level that he counts alone it is stated that the second is more stringent.",

But nevertheless, on this [higher] level, a corpse is more stringent than all of them, as it defiles by overshadowing. For just as a leper causes defilement through entrance, his defilement is not like the defilement of overshadowing, for if he brought his hand into a leprous house, it is pure, and even if he completely entered except for his nose, he is pure, for partial entering is not called entering. And even a partition saves in a house where the leper is, as is taught in the Mishnah of [Tractate] Negaim at the end of the thirteenth chapter [Mishnah 12]: “If he entered the synagogue, they make a partition for him ten handbreadths high [by four cubits wide]. He enters first and leaves last.” And all in a similar manner concerning a corpse that defiles in a tent.

But even though he himself does not defile them, for a vessel does not become susceptible to receive ritual impurity other than from a primary source of ritual impurity. Behold this person states: “what rendered you unclean did not defile me, but you defiled me,”(see also Tractate Kelim 8:4)) as it is taught in the Mishnah in Tractate Parah ]Chapter 8, Mishnayot 2-7], that the Rabbis decreed regarding liquids that they would defile vessels, as a degree because the משקה זב וזבהliquid of a person with gonorrhea/זב and woman suffering from a flux/זבה as was stated in the Tractate Shabbat (which I could not locate. But using the Bar Ilan Responsa Project 25 plus, I was able to locate one mention of a passage with the words\"משקה זב וזבה\"are found only in Tractate Bekhorot 38a. I stand to be corrected). But the [word] “foods” that is taken here, it (i.e., the Mishnah) refers to it just by the way, without specific reason, for food does not defile a vessel, but only liquids defile vessels. But the closing of his lips does not save [from contracting defilement] for an airtight lid does not save/protect from the defilement that is within from defiling others as is taught in the Mishnah above (see Tractate Kelim, Chapter 8, Mishnah 6), and outside from the law , that which is taught in the Tosefta of Tractate Kelim [Bava Kamma, Chapter 6, Halakha 5]: “Everything affords protection from the power of a clay utensil, even a utensil made of dung or a utensil made of stones or a utensil made of dirt – except for man” (see The Tosefta, Jacob Neusner, Volume 2).

Excepting if it is an earthenware vessel that does not defile by treading, and this we derive from Scripture, as it is written (Leviticus 15:5): “Anyone who touches his bedding [shall wash his clothes, bathe in water, and remain impure until evening],” [The Rabbis] make an analogy between “his bedding” and himself, just as he has purity in a ritual bath/Mikveh, even his bedding has purification in a ritual bath, excluding an earthenware vessel which does not have purity in a ritual bath. But the mat of reeds/poor-man’s mattress which is made for lying, even though it doesn’t have ritual purity in a Mikveh, from what is written (Leviticus 11:32): “any such article that can be put to use shall be dipped in water,” but this is not a utensil/article, nevertheless it is impure through treading as we expand upon from Scripture as it is written (Leviticus 15:4): “Any bedding [on which the one with the discharge lies shall be impure],” [the word] “Any” includes the mat of reeds/poor-man’s mattress , but it ha no ritual purity/cleanliness until it is cut/severed and there remains from it less than six [handbreadths] by six [handbreadths]. But stone vessels and vessels of baked ordure and vessels of earth, are pure from everything. And similarly, everything that comes from the ocean is pure. And wooden vessels that hold the prescribed measurements, that contain forty Se’ah moist which are two Kor in dry, are also pure from everything, because they are not carried full. And similarly, anything which does not have the designation of a vessel, or that is the designation of a vessel but is not from things used by human beings, but are used by those who serve his users, is pure, such as the dresser in which olives are spread and the matting of winepresses and the sheet of frames, that we stated in our Mishnah that they are pure from everything, for they are not considered vessels that are attendant upon humans.",
