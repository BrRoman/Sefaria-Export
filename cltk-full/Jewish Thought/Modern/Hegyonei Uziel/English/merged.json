                "7": "You should know that behold the Rambam established the revival of the dead as the thirteenth principle of the thirteen principles of faith and wrote: And the revival of the dead is from the main fundamental principles of Moshe, our teacher - peace be upon him. And there is no religion and no attachment to the Jewish religion for the one who does not believe [in] this. But it is [only] for the righteous (...) And how should the evildoers be revived - as they are dead even in their lifetime? (...) And you should know that man, per force, must die and decompose and return to what he is composed of. (Rambam, Introduction to Chapter Chelek, Commentary on the Mishnah) And so this sage who was reputed for his knowledge of the truth focused on the ultimate end, so he left over everything beside it and [just] said, \"All of Israel has a share in the world to come.\" ",
                "8": "From this we learned that the Rambam, may his memory be blessed, intended, [here] in these laws, to define the concept of the world to come found in the words of our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, as referring to the world of souls, which is after death. And it is the ultimate good, which has nothing similar to it. The mouth cannot speak, nor the mind think, to describe its pleasure and its light. However there are other rewards, and they are the days of the Messiah and the revival of the dead. "

The Jewish redemption is not a selfish redemption, we come in the name of Judaism to free all human beings from their wars, from their devastation, from their superstitions and their primitively oppressive faiths, to save people from tyrannical kingdoms and religious clergy who are hypocrites and cause them to suffer. We don't want to change the order of the whole world but we do want to change something about the world, we wish to free all people on this earth from oppression. Our Rabbis tell us, in the future when Moshiach comes, there is no difference between then and now except oppressive governments that oppress the people. That which will be abolished in the days of Moshiach - it is not only about the Jewish people, but about humanity as a whole. Oppressive governments with their armies and police will not govern, no external power can compel a person to justice and righteousness"
