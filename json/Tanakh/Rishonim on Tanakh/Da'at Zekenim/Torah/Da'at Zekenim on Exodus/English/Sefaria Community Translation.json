Since the dog risked its life over the torn prey when the wolf came to tear it, it should not seem like an imposition of good will towards it that when you have torn prey, you should throw it to the dog as reward for having guarded it until now so it would not be torn, and also to continue guarding the other animals, for thus is the way of the world to appoint dogs to guard the flocks from wolves."

And if Your presence does not go with us, we will not move from here.\" The Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, \"I am not even sending an angel, just the hornet,\" as it is written, (Deuteronomy 7:20) \"And also the hornet.\" And specifically in this world He sends the hornet, but in the future world (Malachi 3:23) \"Behold I am sending Elijah the prophet to you\", as it says, \"Behold I am sending an angel before you.\""

Wherever he is sent, he performs his mission but is unable to show favor, as it is written \"May the Lord lift up His countenance\", and not an angel. For My name is within him, therefore I warn you not to rebel against him as if you were rebelling against Me, since My name is within him and he will not be able to pardon your transgression, for the rebellion depends on Me. An analogy is one who rebels against the word of the treasurer who does not have the power to pardon, for the rebellion depends on the king. Rashi explains that \"My name is within him\" refers to Metatron whose name is like his Master's name, for Metatron has the same numerical value as Shaddai. And a reminder of this is a computation in אתב\"ש coding. And Rabbi Moshe says the reason I state about him that his name is like his Master's name is that his name is spelled out in the Aleph-Beta of Rabbi Akiva, and there it enumerates the 72 names that belong to him."
