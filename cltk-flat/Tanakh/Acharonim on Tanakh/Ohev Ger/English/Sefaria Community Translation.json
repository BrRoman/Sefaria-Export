This is the language of the Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 2): \"It is a positive commandment to believe and listen, which is the acceptance that He is One,\" as it says, \"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One\" (Deuteronomy 6:4). \"Hear\" (שמע) can be understood as \"accept\" in this context."
