And the head is like the greater part of the entire body, for Rabbi El'azar and Rabbi Yoḥanan only disagree in the chapter HaMapelet (Niddah 29a) [about whether the emergence of the head is equivalent to the completion of birth] with regard to miscarriages, but with regard to viable offspring they agree that [the moment of birth is determined by] the emergence of the greater part of head, which is to say his forehead.",
