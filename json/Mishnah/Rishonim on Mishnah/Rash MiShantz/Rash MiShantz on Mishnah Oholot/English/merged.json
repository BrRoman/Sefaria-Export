                "If the greater part has come out. Of the fetus. And the head is like the greater part of the entire body, for Rabbi El'azar and Rabbi Yoḥanan only disagree in the chapter HaMapelet (Niddah 29a) [about whether the emergence of the head is equivalent to the completion of birth] with regard to miscarriages, but with regard to viable offspring they agree that [the moment of birth is determined by] the emergence of the greater part of head, which is to say his forehead.",
