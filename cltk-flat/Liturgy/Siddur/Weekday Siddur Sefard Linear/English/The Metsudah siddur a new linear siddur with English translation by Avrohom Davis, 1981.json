Yet only in your fathers did Adonoy delight, to love them, and He chose their offspring after them, even you among all the peoples as [it is] this day. Circumcise the barrier of your heart, and be stiffnecked no longer. For Adonoy, your God, is God of all powers and the Master of all masters, the Almighty, the Great, the Powerful, the Awesome, Who has no regard for personages and takes no bribes. Who does justice for the orphan and the widow, and loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing. You must love the stranger for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. You must fear Adonoy, your God, serve Him, cleave to Him, and swear by His Name. He is your praise, and He is your God, Who did with you all these great and awesome things that your eyes have seen. With seventy people your fathers descended to Egypt, and now Adonoy, your God, has made you as abundant as the stars of heaven.

And what He did unto Dathan and Aviram, the sons of Eliav, son of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them, and their households, their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel. But your eyes have seen all the great deeds of Adonoy, that He performed. You should [therefore] keep all the commandments which I command you this day, so you will be strong, and go in and possess the land, to which you are passing over to possess it.
