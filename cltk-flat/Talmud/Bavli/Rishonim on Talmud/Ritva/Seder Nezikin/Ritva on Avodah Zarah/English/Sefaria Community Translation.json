        "85_Daf, 1_Comment": "Do not make with Me’ — do not make Me. The meaning is like what the verse says in reference to humans: ‘in the image of God He made him’ (Genesis 1:27). Even though it is metaphorical, the verse is cautious about making such images due to the honor of the Divine. All these interpretations drawn from 'do not make with Me' are considered collectively significant and equal in importance, and all fall under the commandment of 'with Me.' You might ask: since a human face alone is prohibited, why is it necessary to prohibit an image with four faces? After all, it includes a human face within it. The answer is that even so, I might have thought that an image of four faces would be permissible if one begins by drawing the other faces (first), and that the Torah only prohibits the image when it is made alone. Thus, this comes to teach us otherwise."
