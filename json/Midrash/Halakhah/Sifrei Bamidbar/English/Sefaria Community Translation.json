            "(Bamidbar 5:10) \"And a man, his holy things, to him shall they be\": All kodshim (\"holies\") were included in \"And a man, his holy things, to him shall they be.\" Scripture \"pulled out\" all the kodshim and gave them to the Cohanim, leaving over (to the owners) only (\"portions\") of thank-offerings, peace-offerings, the Pesach offering, beast-tithe, second-tithe, and neta revai (plantings of the fourth year). Variantly: And a man, his holy things, to him shall they be\": From here you derive that to the Cohein who performs the sacrifice (even in a different watch), its service (i.e., its flesh) and its skin belong \"to him\" (the Cohein). Variantly: \"And a man, his holy things, to him shall they be\": What is the intent of this? From (Vayikra 19:24) \"And in the fourth year all of its fruit shall be holy in praise of the L-rd,\" (I would not know) \"holy\" to the owners or \"holy\" to the Cohanim? It is, therefore, written \"And a man, his holy things, to him shall they be.\" Scripture here speaks of neta revai, that it belongs to the owners. These are the words of R. Meir. R. Shimon says: \"holy\" to the owners. You say \"holy\" to the owners, but perhaps it is \"holy\" to the Cohanim! — You derive it thus: second-tithe is called \"holy\" (viz. Devarim 26:13) \"and neta revai is called \"holy.\" Just as second-tithe is \"holy\" to the owners, so, neta revai should belong to the owners. — (No,) this is refuted by terumah, which is called \"holy\" (viz. Vayikra 22:14) and yet belongs to the Cohanim. — Would you say that? There is a difference. Second-tithe requires bringing to the place (Jerusalem) and neta revai requires bringing to the place. If I learned that second-tithe belongs to the owners, neta revai should belong to the owners. — (No,) this is refuted by bikkurim, which, even though they require bringing to the place, belong to the Cohanim. — Would you say that? There is a difference. Second-tithe is called \"holy,\" and requires bringing to the place, and redemption. And neta revai is called \"holy,\" and requires bringing to the place, and redemption. And this is not to be refuted by terumah, which, even though it is called \"holy,\" does not require bringing to the place, nor by bikkurim, which, even though they require bringing to the place, do not require redemption. I will learn a thing from a thing, and I will reason out a thing from a thing. I will learn a thing of three facets from a thing that is similar in (these) three facets, and I will not learn a thing of three facets from a thing which is not similar in (these) three facets, but only in one or two. If I have learned, then, that second-tithe belongs to the owners, then neta revai, too, should belong to the owners. R. Yossi says \"holy\" to the owners. You say \"holy\" to the owners, but perhaps it is \"holy\" to the Cohanim! — It is, therefore, written (of neta revai, Vayikra 19:25) \"And in the fifth year you may eat its fruit to increase for you its produce.\" For whom is it increased? For him to whom it has already been given (in the fourth year, i.e., the owner.)  The Messiah foretold, he dwells solitary on an island He is the \"The Guided One.\" accompanied by a mighty giant of a unknown race."

Rabbi Akiva says : \"A thousand to a tribe, a thousand to a tribe\" : 12,000 all together. What does \"from all the tribes of Israel you shall send into the army\" teach us? To include the tribe of Levi! \"And there were handed over of the thousands of Israel\": Scripture hereby apprises us that they were just and righteous men, who gave of themselves for the cause. R. Nathan says: Others handed them over: \"This man is kasher — Let him go! This man is a tzaddik — Let him go!\" R. Elazar Hamodai says: Come and see the love (of Israel for) the shepherd of Israel. So long as they had not heard that the death of Moses was attendant upon the war with Midian, what is written of them? (Shemot 17:4) \"Just a little more and they will stone me.\" When they heard of it, they began hiding (to avoid conscription, so as not to be instrumental in his death) — notwithstanding which they were conscripted perforce, viz. \"And there were handed over of the thousands of Israel, etc.\""
