Understand this! For a wonderful and very pleasing explanation of this, see <i>Likutey Halakhot, Yoreh Deah, Milah</i> 5:23ff.

However, sometimes, the demons attach themselves to the other members of the household, causing them to suffer as a result of their quarreling and contentiousness. This is explicitly found in the verse, “Their homes are peaceful, without fear...” (Job 21:9), about which the Sages teach: “without fear”—these are the demons.
