            "But the wise ones know their own value; they do not exceed judgment regarding their wealth, and all the more so regarding their bodies. This is called the value of the wise. As it says in the Talmud (Eruvin 53a), Rabbi Yochanan said: \"The heart of the earlier ones is like the entrance to the hall, and the heart of the later ones is like the entrance to the sanctuary, and we are like the eye of a fine needle.\" The earlier ones—Rabbi Akiva. The later ones—Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua. Some say, the earlier ones—Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua. The later ones—Rabbi Oshaya the great. And we are like the eye of a fine needle. Abaye said: \"We are like a peg in a wall for learning.\" Rava said: \"We are like a finger in wax for reasoning.\" Rav Ashi said: \"We are like a finger in a pit for forgetfulness.\" Thus far. They admitted without shame, giving proper measure to the earlier ones and to the later ones, and they acknowledged their own place."
