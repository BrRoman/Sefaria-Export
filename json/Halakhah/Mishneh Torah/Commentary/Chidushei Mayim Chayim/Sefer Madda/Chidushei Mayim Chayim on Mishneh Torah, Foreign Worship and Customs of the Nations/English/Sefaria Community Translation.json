                "Know that the Tosafists in the third chapter of Avodah Zarah inferred from the sugya (Talmudic discussion) that from the fact that we question, \"But wasn't Rabban Gamliel an individual?\" and do not answer that in Rabban Gamliel's case it was not prominent, it follows that with regard to the sun and the moon, there is no distinction between prominent and recessed. This is a contradiction to the opinion of the Ra'avad. To me, this does not pose any difficulty at all. For if it were the case that Rabban Gamliel's matter involved a non-prominent form, then why was it explained that \"others made it for him\"? For he could have made it himself! Therefore, it is clear that the one answering holds that it was a prominent form, and thus the question \"Wasn't Rabban Gamliel an individual?\" was indeed appropriate. In this way, the Tosafists' proof is refuted. Investigate this, and see in the responsa of the Radbaz, siman 107, and in the Maharit, part two, Yoreh De'ah, siman 35, and there is room to analyze their words, with God's help."
