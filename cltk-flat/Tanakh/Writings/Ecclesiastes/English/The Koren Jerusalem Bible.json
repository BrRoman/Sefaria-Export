        "4_Chapter, 6_Verse": "If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and the violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, do not marvel at the matter: for there is a high one who watches over him that is high; and there are yet higher ones over them.",

        "5_Chapter, 10_Verse": "Seeing there are many things that increase vanity, what is man the better?",
        "5_Chapter, 11_Verse": "For who knows what is good for man in this life, all the days of his vain life which he spends like a shadow? for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?",

        "6_Chapter, 11_Verse": "For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom gives life to those who have it.",
        "6_Chapter, 12_Verse": "Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he has made crooked?",
        "6_Chapter, 13_Verse": "In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.",
        "6_Chapter, 14_Verse": "All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who prolongs his life in his wickedness.",
        "6_Chapter, 15_Verse": "Be not righteous overmuch; nor make thyself overwise: why shouldst thou destroy thyself?",

        "6_Chapter, 17_Verse": "It is good that thou shouldst take hold of this; but do not withdraw thy hand from that either: for he that fears God performs them all.",
        "6_Chapter, 18_Verse": "Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten rulers who are in a city.",
        "6_Chapter, 19_Verse": "For there is not a just man upon earth, that does good, and sins not.",
        "6_Chapter, 20_Verse": "Also take no heed to all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:",
        "6_Chapter, 21_Verse": "for oftentimes also thy own heart knows that thou thyself hast likewise cursed others.",
        "6_Chapter, 22_Verse": "All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.",
        "6_Chapter, 23_Verse": "That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?",
        "6_Chapter, 24_Verse": "I cast about in my mind to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and foolishness which is madness:",
        "6_Chapter, 25_Verse": "and I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands are fetters: he who pleases God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be caught by her.",
        "6_Chapter, 26_Verse": "Behold, this have I found, says Qohelet, counting one thing to another, to find out the sum,",
        "6_Chapter, 27_Verse": "which yet my soul seeks, but I have not found it: One man among a thousand I have found; but a woman among all those I have not found.",

        "7_Chapter, 4_Verse": "He who keeps the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s heart discerns both time and method.",
        "7_Chapter, 5_Verse": "For every matter has its time and method, though the misery of man is great upon him.",
        "7_Chapter, 6_Verse": "For he knows not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?",
        "7_Chapter, 7_Verse": "There is no man who has power over the wind to retain the wind; nor has he power over the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; nor shall wickedness deliver those who are given up to it.",
        "7_Chapter, 8_Verse": "All this have I seen, and have appointed my heart to every work that is done under the sun: there is a time when one man rules over another to his own hurt.",
        "7_Chapter, 9_Verse": "And so I saw the wicked buried, and come to their rest; but those who had done right were gone from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.",
        "7_Chapter, 10_Verse": "Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.",
        "7_Chapter, 11_Verse": "Though a sinner do evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those who fear God, who fear before him:",
        "7_Chapter, 12_Verse": "but it shall not be well with the wicked, and, like the shadow, he will not prolong his days; because he does not fear before God.",
        "7_Chapter, 13_Verse": "There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there are just men, to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.",
        "7_Chapter, 14_Verse": "So I commend mirth, because a man has no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall accompany him in his labour during the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.",
        "7_Chapter, 15_Verse": "When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (how one sees no sleep with one’s eyes either by day or by night;)",
        "7_Chapter, 16_Verse": "then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; furthermore; though a wise man think to know it, yet he shall not be able to find it.",
        "8_Chapter, 0_Verse": "For all this I laid to my heart, and sought to clarify all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their deeds, are in the hand of God: no man knows whether love or hatred is in store: all is before them.",
        "8_Chapter, 1_Verse": "All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him who sacrifices, and to him who does not sacrifice: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he who swears, as he who fears an oath.",
