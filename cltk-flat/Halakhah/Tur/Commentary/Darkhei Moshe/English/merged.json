        "0_Orach Chaim, 127_Siman, 13_Seif Katan, 0_Paragraph": "And the priests have followed the practice of extending their tunes in six places — those being with the word, May He bless you; with, and may he guard you; with upon you; with, give you grace; with, upon you; and with, peace. And they extend these words more than the other words. And I have heard a reason for this thing, because each of these places is the end of a blessing on its own. For there are six blessings in these three verses. Hence they extend every end of a blessing a little. And in the Beit Yosef, [Rabbi Yosef Karo writes] in the name of the Rokeach that the priests turn to the south and to the north during these six words, and it is possible that it is also for this reason. (But see the end of this section in the Beit Yosef as he counts more than six, since he also counts the word, to you. And with that, this reason is not relevant.) And they have followed the practice to say, \"Master of the worlds,\" when the priests are singing sweetly at the end of the words, and may he guard you, give you grace, and peace. Maharil wrote in section 148 that the one prompting should not say, \"Master, etc.,\" because of confusion.\n",
        "0_Orach Chaim, 472_Siman, 17_Seif Katan, 0_Paragraph": "In the Maharil (Our teacher, Rabbi Yaakov Levi Moelin): But if his wife and his children [already] ask him [relevant questions], there is no need to say <i>Mah Nishtanah</i> (How is it different). So one just begins from, \"We were slaves.\" Also there: When one reaches, \"Blood, Fires and Pillars of Smoke,\" he should remove [some of the wine in his cup] with his finger. And likewise when one says, \"<i>Datzach, Adash, Baachab</i>\" (the initials of the ten plagues), individually and as groups. The total is sixteen times. And this was the custom of our teacher Rabbi Shalom (of Neustadt). And he said that it is so in the book of Aviah (R. Eliezer ben Yoel HaLevi) - that it corresponds to the sixteen faces of the <i>chayot</i> (a type of angel). To here are his words. But it appears that it hints here to the sword of the Holy One, blessed be He, which is called, <i>Yohakh</i> (<i>Yo</i> has a numerical value of sixteen, and <i>hakh</i> means, strike). And that is [the name of] the angel appointed for vengeance, as is known to the Kabbalists. And it is customary to remove [wine] from the cup with the [fore]finger, to hint at that which is stated (Exodus 8:15), \"This is the finger of God\"; and not like I found written in the Hanhagat Minhagim, that one should sprinkle with the pinkie.

        "0_Orach Chaim, 668_Siman, 2_Seif Katan, 0_Paragraph": "Maharik wrote [in] Shoresh 26 in the name of a responsum of the Geonim that on the day of Simchat Torah, our practice is to dance - even the elderly - while we say praises about the Torah scroll. Even though we do not dance on a holiday, our practice is to permit [it] on account of the honor of the Torah. To here are his [words]. And the Maharil wrote: There are places where the practice is for the children to destroy the sukkot (huts) and burn them on Simchat Torah and they give an explanation to permit this. However my father and teacher, may his memory be blessed would protest against me when I was young to not destroy it on a holiday. To here are his [words]. ",
        "1_Yoreh Deah, 88_Siman, 1_Seif Katan, 0_Paragraph": "In the Mordechai at the beginning of the chapter Kol HaBasar (Talmud Chullin):  \"A responsum of Maharam (of Rothenburg):  Once, from one meal to the next I found cheese between (my) teeth.  I made a personal decree to be strict (regarding eating) meat following cheese (just as one must wait before eating) cheese following meat; with fowl, I am lenient (to eat fowl directly after cheese),\" end quote. / Here is the discussion of Issur veHeiter Ha'Aroch chapter 40: \"If one ate soft cheese younger than (Hebrew should read: קודם) six months or other kinds of milk (products), he may eat meat immediately at the same meal by means of cleaning out (Hebrew should read: קינוח) and washing his hands and mouth.  However, if one eats twelve-month old cheese or moldy (מתולעת, 'wormy') cheese, even though no prohibition pertains, nevertheless it is a measure of piety not to eat meat afterwards at the same meal, in accordance with the responsum (Hebrew should read: כתשובת) of Maharam,\" end quote. / And so, many have the practice not to eat meat after (eating) hard cheese that sticks between the teeth, just as we do not eat cheese after meat. / And Beit Yosef wrote in Orach Chaim, chapter 173, \"Yet there are those who practice a personal stringency not to eat meat after cheese at the same meal\" and thus one finds in the Zohar that one should be strict in this matter.  Therefore one should be strict even with fowl following cheese.  If the Maharam had seen the Zohar, he would not have been lenient with fowl.  That is the end of his words there.  He quoted the Zohar on this issue.  ",
        "1_Yoreh Deah, 140_Siman, 1_Seif Katan, 0_Paragraph": "The Ran wrote in Perek 25, page 383, The Rashba wrote  that in this time, when they engrave on vessels and draw the image of an idol on them even someone who finds vessels that have the image of an idol on them, they are forbidden and furthermore, it is their way among the great ones to draw on their swords the image of their weapons of war and they embrace and kiss them during war end of quote. And it requires further analysis because today, they do not worship these images at all, but they make them only as a mere remembrance, end of quote.",
        "1_Yoreh Deah, 140_Siman, 3_Seif Katan, 0_Paragraph": "And so it was ruled (or practiced) in the chapter \"Hakkelev Hameivi\" (name of a Talmudic chapter) and the fourth chapter of \"Rosh Hashanah.\"  However, in the Ran, it is written in the name of Rav Alfasi (Rif) and the Rambam, that any form (image) that is prohibited to make is also prohibited to keep if others made it for him, according to the opinion of the Tur.  And the Ran also wrote that even when it is not raised (i.e., not a three-dimensional or protruding form), it is only permitted regarding the sun, the moon, stars, and constellations, but forms from the \"upper realm\" (celestial beings or divine imagery) are prohibited, even if they are recessed (not raised). And this is contrary to the words of our teacher, the Tur, from which it is implied that all forms are only prohibited to make if they are raised. And in the Hagahot Asheri (on the 25th chapter), it is written that a ring that has the form of an idol on it, even if raised, is forbidden to use for sealing, according to the Or Zarua (a halachic work).",
        "1_Yoreh Deah, 140_Siman, 4_Seif Katan, 0_Paragraph": "And the Mordechai wrote in Chapter 55 in the name of Maharam that no image is forbidden to be made unless it is protruding, and so it is in the Mekhilta, but to draw with colors is permitted, even for a Jew himself to draw.  But a protruding or indented seal is certainly forbidden for a Jew to make and it seems from the prohibition to make an indented seal that it applies even to the images of the sun and the moon and even so, by means of colors, it is permitted and so it is in the responsa of Maharam in the Mordechai, in the section on 'All the Images'.  For it is not appropriate to say 'you shall not make for yourself' (an idol) with respect to colored images, because they are neither protruding nor indented and therefore, those who draw images in Machzorim (prayer books) and prayers do not need to be concerned about the prohibition of idolatry but it is forbidden to do so because they (the congregants) look at them during prayers and do not direct their hearts toward Heaven. end of quote.\n"
