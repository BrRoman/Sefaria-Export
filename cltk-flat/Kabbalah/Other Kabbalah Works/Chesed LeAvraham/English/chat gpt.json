        "1_Even Shetiya, 1_Maayan 2, 31_Nahar, 1_Paragraph": "The matter is that the Torah scholar, known as the \"son who serves his father\" but does not do so for the purpose of receiving reward and merit for fulfilling the commandments in this world. Furthermore, what is more, the side of Atzilut (Emanation) does not become corporeal at all, and therefore, in the physical world, it has nothing.",
        "1_Even Shetiya, 1_Maayan 2, 31_Nahar, 2_Paragraph": "So what does the common person do? They make themselves a vessel and garment for the Torah scholar from the food and drink they provide. The reason is that the common person has no other reward to their credit. Since they are righteous, they are not credited with anything. On Shabbat, when they do not cook any physical food, it is a spiritual day, not a physical one, and they do not engage in physical needs. The matter is that the additional soul that the common person has on Shabbat is what the Torah scholar has on weekdays. The reason is that they are together on Shabbat at a time when the father has an additional soul. In the usage that they participate in together, they both share the additional soul of Shabbat, as mentioned in the Zohar Terumah 146, in such a way that the Torah scholar always has an additional soul, and on Shabbat, they have twice as much.",
        "1_Even Shetiya, 1_Maayan 2, 31_Nahar, 3_Paragraph": "If a common person is generous with their wealth to provide food, clothing, and all the needs of the Torah scholar on Shabbat, they will receive their words in Torah and behave in the statutes of the Torah like their peers. In their merit, they will be saved from the Angel of Death, so the Satan will not have dominion over them, and they will be saved from Gehinnom, the defective sword, as the righteous die by a precise sword, which is the side of holiness. Therefore, they draw near to the offering upon the altar above, the secret of the \"Elevation Offerings of Israel,\" and their prayer is quickly accepted with love, and so on. This is the secret."
