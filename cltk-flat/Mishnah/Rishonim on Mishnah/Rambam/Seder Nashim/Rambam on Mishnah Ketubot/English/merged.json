Therefore, he [presumably referring to himself] may eat the fruits during her lifetime, and if she dies, her heir [presumably referring to herself] may inherit [the fruits], etc.\"",
        "8_Chapter, 0_Mishnah, 1_Comment": "This writing is problematic when he wrote to her, and she is still engaged, about the principle we have regarding inheritance that comes to a person from another place. A person can make a condition upon it that he will not inherit it, or even if he acquired it from her after marriage. \"Fruit of fruits\" refers to when the woman sells fruits that were separated from her husband, and the buyer takes them with their value as payment for the land. The husband may eat the fruits of this land, even though he has no actual ownership of the land itself, as he did not contribute to its acquisition. He only benefits from the initial fruits. When he said, \"I have nothing of yours,\" he was referring to her possessions and fruits, but the fruits of fruits he may eat according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, until he writes, \"and the fruits of her fruits forever.\" ",
        "8_Chapter, 0_Mishnah, 2_Comment": "Regarding the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel, who made a condition contrary to what is written in the Torah, it is a reason that is not truly valid because the main principle among us is the husband's inheritance, which is a rabbinic enactment. However, they strengthened it as a safeguard to the Torah, and therefore the law follows Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel when he said that the husband will inherit it, based on the reason we mentioned. And the law follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda."
