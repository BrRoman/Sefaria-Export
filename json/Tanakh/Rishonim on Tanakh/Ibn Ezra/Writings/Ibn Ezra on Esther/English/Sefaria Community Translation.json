                "<b>and he changed:</b> He changed the portions, to do good to her. And the explanation of \"the house of the women\" is that it is connected to, \"and he changed her portions and [those of her maidens\" - and that was in the house of the women with her colleagues. Some say that Mordekhai did not act correctly when he commanded Esther not to mention her nation, since he was afraid that the king would not take her as a wife if he knew that she was from the exile. And others say that it was by way of prophecy or a dream that he knew that the salvation would come through her to the Jewish people. But what seems correct to me is that Mordekhai did this in order that she could observe the Torah of God secretly, such that she would not eat carcasses and could observe the Shabbat, and the guards would not be aware. For if the matter would be known, perhaps the king would force her [to do otherwise] or kill her, since she was taken by force. And we know that Mordekhai was from the greats of the Jewish people. As behold, he was the third of the ministers that came up [to Israel] with Zerubavel. But when he saw that the Temple was not built, he came to Eilam and was situated at the gate of the king in the palace, which is a great honor. Behold, Daniel had appointed his colleagues over the Babylonian kingdom, and he was at the gate of the king. But had Mordekhai not been among the servants of the king before the story with Esther, the servants would not have let him walk around in the courtyard of the house of the women."
