So too may You wrap my soul – my 248 limbs and my 365 tendons – in the light of the <i>tsitsit</i>, [the letters, strings and knots of] which add up to 613. And in the same way that I cover myself with a prayer shawl in this world, so too may I merit to be in the section of the rabbis and to have a fine prayer shawl in the next world, in the Garden of Eden. And through the commandment of <i>tsitsit</i>, save my essence, my spirit, my soul and my prayer from [negative forces].

The trochophore has independent development, it cannot make contact with bonellin on its mother or the sand ground. 2. It is paralyzed with man o war poison. 3. It is exposed to a radioactive spring. 4. It is exposed to the alarm pheromone of its mother. Triggered by first coating the proboscis of mother with acid from slightly heated olive oil and ashes from burned wood. This is to break up the stickiness of the bonellin and mucus in proboscis. It will also break down the bonellin made so that it can no longer paralyze creatures that attack it. This will cause it to not be able to catch food and defend itself. It helps to have food pushed down into its tail in order for the fish to be aware of the food not sticking. Also, it helps for it to switch from light to darkness constantly. In order for it to be aware that the problem is not because there isn't enough  light but the bonellin is. Also, cutting its setae hairs triggers this. It will then stop making bonellin. It takes about 1 month for this to happen. The rest of the bonellin and mucus that is stored in the proboscis can be cleared by putting hot spices in it and blowing hot air inside. And then you make a cut in its mouth so that it bleeds.</i>"
