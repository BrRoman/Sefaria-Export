All the prohibitions that apply to close relatives of a divorced wife also apply to the close relatives of his levirate wife. Similarly, he is forbidden to marry the sister-in-law of his levirate wife, as the sister-in-law of his levirate wife is considered as ervah (forbidden relation), and we have already explained (in Chapter 1, Halacha 1) that the sister-in-law of one's ervah is forbidden."
