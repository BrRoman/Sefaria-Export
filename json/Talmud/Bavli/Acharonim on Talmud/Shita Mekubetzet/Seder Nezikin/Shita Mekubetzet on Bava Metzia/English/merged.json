For since it is something that does not have an identifying mark, he presumably surely abandoned it and it became ownerless."

            "This is the wording of the Ritva: \"Regarding the question we raised from the case of one who finds money in synagogues and study halls, it seems, based on the sugya, that the difficulty is directed only according to Abaye. \" This is very puzzling to me, for that case involves something that has a sign, and there would be no despair , even according to Rava, as stated earlier. Moreover, the Rabbis dispute him and hold that one is obligated to announce it. So, rather than challenging from Rabbi Shimon, why not support the Rabbis? One could explain that the reasoning of this Mishnah is that for anything that falls in a place where the a lot of people are present, the owners despair of recovering it as if it had no sign. And as long as the owners are unaware [of the loss], it is considered unintentional despair in the case of something that has no sign. However, the Rabbis who say one is obligated to announce it hold that since it has a sign, the owners do not typically despair of it. Therefore, even if the owners eventually despair, it is considered unintentional despair regarding an item that has a sign, and it was acquired in a prohibited manner. Thus, our teacher explained.  Tosafos writes: \"And why did Rabbi Yitzchak not state his ruling in connection with the Mishnah?\" I heard that Rabbi Yitzchak did not state this explicitly, but rather derived it later from the verse, 'and you shall bind up the money in your hand'—even if it is bound up, it should remain in your hand. This is noted in the gloss within Tosafos of Shaantz. Additionally, Tosafos writes: \"Regarding the Beraisa, it is difficult to raise a question.\" This means that since it says that the majority are present there, it implies that the case applies universally, even if there is a sign. The reasoning is explained later, as it assumes the majority are non-Jews or unreliable individuals, for which there is uncertainty in the text later. Later, Tosafos raises the question: \"If the case involves the majority being non-Jews, then why does it say the owners despair? It should suffice to say it fell from non-Jews, as we follow the majority.\" Tosafos answers that it mentions the owners' despair to teach that even if it fell from a Jew, it becomes the finder’s property, as the loser despairs, as explained later in Tosafos. Since the case involves seeing it fall from a Jew, it must mean the finder came across it immediately after it fell. However, the Mishnah could be interpreted to refer to cases where the money had been lying there for a long time—or perhaps we even assume this in cases of doubt, as it is common, and we do not need to worry about the possibility that it fell immediately. Alternatively, one could explain the plain meaning of the Mishnah as referring to a situation where the money fell a long time ago. In contrast, the Beraisa, as is proven later, applies universally—even in cases where there is a sign—and also applies universally, even if the money is still in the house. This is noted in the gloss.\""

            "<b>And some say in 46 places:</b> If you would say, \"Where do we find these 46 places? Do we not find above only 3 negative commandments?\" One could say that Rabbi Eliezer counted all the places where \"stranger\" is mentioned, such as \"you were stragers\" and \"you shall love the stranger\" etc. Thus taught the RaP (R. Perez ben Elijah of Corbeil). But the RAVaD (R. Abraham ben David) wrote: \"It seems to me that every place Scripture mentions 'a stranger' or 'as a stranger' or 'as a citizen' etc. - he counts as a mention. But it appears to me that the count is only 36 and not 46, and the disagreement between these counts is due to the fact that one considers all the places where a stranger is mentioned, while the other excludes these same places in Torah where 'poor,' 'orphan,' and 'widow' are [also] mentioned.\""
