                    "0": "Therefore, after the rabbi resembles a parent (in teaching), do not say, “If I do not find a teacher for free who resembles a parent, only one for full payment who resembles a seller, I will refrain from learning.” For indeed, this is my advice: “Truth, buy it even with money.” Because it is he (the teacher) who loses out, not you. However, do not sell teaching for payment as you were taught, for if you do so, you will not resemble a parent but rather a seller. For you will become detached from the holiness of the Torah, as you sell it for money, and he (the student) will connect to it and acquire holiness from it. And you will not be considered like a parent who is connected to their offspring. This is what I have commanded you: Do not sell. It refers to wisdom, ethics, and understanding—not the written Torah (Mikra), for it is permitted to teach it for payment, but rather wisdom and ethics, which are study and practice (i.e., the Oral Torah, its intellectual wisdom, and ethical guidance). For all the performance of mitzvot depends on the Oral Torah, both the understanding you derive from your comprehension of their words and the actions that follow. This is what “understanding” refers to—not just what is written in the Mikra (the written Torah) alone."
