            "Malmo, Sweden, Shevat 5757 (1998)",
            "<b>Leaving a dead body over night for the sake of purification (<i>taharah</i></b>",
            "<b>Question</b>",
            "Earlier many Jews lived in villages far from Malmo. But now only a very few of our fellow Jews are found in these places. However they have a cemetery that they continue to use until today. In these places, there is no possibility of doing purification onsite. Is it permissible to delay the funeral by a day in order to do the purification in our city, or must one make efforts to bury [the body] as soon as possible? We would add that the law in Sweden is that we must wait at least 24 hours between the confirmation of a death and the burial.",
            "<b>Answer</b>",
            "1) When it is impossible to bury the body on account of some duress, such as because of the laws of the country, there is no prohibition of leaving a body overnight,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The prohibition of leaving over a dead body is learned from the verse in Deuteronomy 21:23, brought down in the Gemara, Sanhedrin (46a) and codified in the Shulchan Arukh (Yoreh Deah 357:1). And there is a negative commandment of, \"do not leave over,\" here as well. According to some decisors, there is also a positive commandment of, \"surely bury him on that day.<br>If they did not bury him until sunset (when it is possible), they have then transgressed the positive commandment. And if they delayed it until dawn they have then also transgressed the negative commandment (though there are some that say that they already transgressed the negative commandment from the beginning of the night); and there is no mention among the decisors of twenty-fours regarding this topic. And if he dies at night, there are some that have the practice of burying him before the dawn.</i> However once the duress is no longer present, the prohibition reappears, and the dead body can only be left overnight for the honor [of the one who died].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Everything said in footnote 1 is when they left it overnight without extenuating circumstances. However when they left it overnight for his honor, it is permissible, as it is brought in the Gemara, ibid., and codified in the Shulchan Arukh, ibid.</i>",
            "2) The purification of the dead body is an aspect of the dead person's honor;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The essence of the custom of purification appears in the Gemara, Shabbat (151a) and in the Shulchan Arukh (Yoreh Deah, 352:74), and there are many things within it, which are related to the mystical Torah. And in the book, Kol Bo Aveilut (6:1), he cites Ramban that the purification is for the honor of the dead person.</i> hence it is possible to delay the burial until after the purification.",
            "3) If the family members oppose waiting for the purification and want to bury the dead person immediately the way he is, the matter should be explained to them. However if they insist, he should be brought to a regular Jewish burial,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Kol Bo Aveilut (6:14).</i> like any dead body.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Responsa B'Mareh HaBazak (III:62).</i>"
