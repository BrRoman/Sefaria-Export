                    "26": "...\nWhen the serpent came to Eve, it cast impurity into her. Israel, who stood at Mount Sinai, ceased their impurity. The meaning of this is when the serpent overcame and had dominion over Eve, like the dominion of a man over his wife, who is subdued under him and follows him, it cast impurity into her.",
                    "27": "This means the following after excesses which distract her from following the human (intellect), which is the intellect. And Israel, who stood at Mount Sinai, ceased their impurity, which is the impurity of corrupt opinions and following after excesses. He gave them the Torah, which guides them to have the material subdued under them and to rule over it with the appropriate dominion.",
                    "28": "But the nations of the world who did not stand at Mount Sinai, their impurity did not cease. The meaning of this is the impurity of corrupt opinions and the impurity of their following after excesses."
