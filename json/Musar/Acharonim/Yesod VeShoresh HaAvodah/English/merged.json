                "<b>The third blessing</b> is You are holy and Your name is holy. With this blessing, a person should rejoice with great tremendous joy about the great holiness of our Maker and our Creator, may His name be blessed and exalted. And the holy ones [in the blessing] are the Jewish people, who are called holy ones, as Abudarham explains. But it is appropriate to also have the supernal angles in mind [when saying this term]. Blessed are You Lord, the holy God: He should rejoice with tremendous joy, as mentioned above. And the sum and count of the words in these three blessings is explained in the Zohar Chadash 35a, and a person should reflect upon their great loftiness from this. With the amen in this blessing, one should have in mind that it is true that He is holy and His holiness cannot be grasped; and he should rejoice with tremendous joy, as mentioned above."
