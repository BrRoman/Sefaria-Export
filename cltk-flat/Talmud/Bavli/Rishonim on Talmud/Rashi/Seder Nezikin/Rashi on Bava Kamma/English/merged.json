Another interpretation: he has [the protection of] fortune, and it is not easy to kill him with <i>negifa</i> -- that is, with a slight pushing of the horn [alone] -- but rather [only] with goring, with force and intention and with the thrusting of the horn into the body.",
        "3_Daf, 12_Line, 0_Comment": "And Scripture teaches us a matter in passing - since it apportions the term \"goring\" to [where the victim is] a person and \"<i>negifa</i>\" to [where the victim is] an animal, implying that it is easier [for the ox] to kill an animal than to kill a person. This implies that an ox that was forewarned due to having killed an animal three times is not considered forewarned regarding [killing] people. Thus if it gored a person to death, it is judged as an innocuous ox, and [the owner] does not pay the ransom. Regarding an innocuous one who kills a person, it is written \"the ox shall be stoned... but the owner of the ox is not to be punished\" [Exodus 21:28]. Regarding a forewarned one it is written \"its owner, too, shall be put to death\" [Exodus 21:29]. \"Death\" there means monetary compensation, in that he must pay the ransom -- the value of the one who was killed -- to his heirs; not actual death, as it is stated in the first chapter of Sanhedrin: You execute him for his act of murder, but you do not execute him for his ox’s act of murder [Sanhedrin 15b:5]. However, [an ox] that is forewarned regarding [killing] people is considered forewarned with respect to animals. It is possible to [have a case of an ox that is] forewarned with respect to killing people, if it gored three times before being brought to court -- thus it had not been stoned immediately upon having killed the first [person].",

This works out well according to Shmuel, who says...\" etc. \"... But according to Rav [...] what is there to say? [...] Rav Adda bar Minyumi interpreted it...\" etc. And the explanation of it is as follows: the first person is liable for damage cause to the second person, whether he was damaged by the body of the first person or whether he was damaged by the property of the first person. His body is judged according to the law of [a Person] who damages, and is [therefore] liable even for [damage to] the second person's utensils -- we do not equate [the law of damage done by] his body to the law of the Pit. His property[, however,] is in the category of Pit -- he is [therefore] liable for [damage caused to] the body of the second person and exempt for [damage done to] his utensils. If [the first person's] property damaged [the second person's] property -- since Pit is liable for damage to a person, as we have said earlier: when do we apply the exposition of the verse \"an ox\" [Exodus 21:33] but not a person -- with regard to a situation where the person is killed, but with regard to damages, [the digger of the pit] is liable [Bava Kamma 28b:2]. But [Pit] is exempt for [damage caused to] utensils. The second person is liable for damage caused to the third person -- according to the law of [a Person] who damages -- where [the third person] was damaged by the body of the second person, but not for damage caused by his property. If the second person's property damaged the third person's body, he is not liable -- not even the law of Pit is applicable to the second person's cookware to the extent that it would have made him liable to the damage it caused, not even if it caused damage to the third person's body.",

[Bava Kamma 98b:6] And is it not a rationale that the Rabbis accepted and thus taught that they concede regarding unleavened bread [after] Passover, that regarding items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit one may say \"that which is yours is before you\"? Rather, all agree that one may say \"that which is yours is before you\" regarding items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit where the prohibition comes automatically, such as with leavened bread on Passover, where one cannot say to the other \"this is of no consequence.\" But here, it is because of this that the Rabbis say it is not considered returned: since [the owner could have] said to [the bailee] \"now you have let my ox be seized\", etc., this is an active form of damaging in that [the bailee complied with] taking [the ox] to the court. The language [Rabba] chose \"if you had returned [the ox] to me\" is not to say that the liability is because he did not return it to him [before the court case], because if so, he could also have said in the context of the case of leavened bread on Passover \"if you had returned it to me I would have eaten it\" [and thereby cause the robber to be liable]. Furthermore, according to Rabbi Ya'akov as well, since [he holds that] the verdict for an ox can be issued in its absence, let him say \"if you had returned it to me I would have slaughtered it\". Rather, the Rabbis do not make him liable for returning it now not having returned it earlier; regarding items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit one does indeed say \"that which is yours is before you\". Rather, his liability comes because [the bailee] actively brought [the ox] before the court.
