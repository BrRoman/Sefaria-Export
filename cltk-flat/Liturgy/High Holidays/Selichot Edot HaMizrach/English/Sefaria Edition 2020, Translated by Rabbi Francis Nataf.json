        "1_Paragraph": "Happy are those who dwell in Your house; they forever praise You. Selah. A song of praise of David. I will extol You, my God and King, and bless Your name forever and ever. Every day will I bless You and praise Your name forever and ever. Great is the Lord and much acclaimed; His greatness cannot be fathomed. One generation shall laud Your works to another and declare Your mighty acts. The glorious majesty of Your splendor and Your wondrous acts will I recite. Men shall talk of the might of Your awesome deeds, and I will recount Your greatness. They shall celebrate Your abundant goodness, and sing joyously of Your beneficence. The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in kindness. The Lord is good to all, and His mercy is upon all His works. All Your works shall praise You, Lord, and Your faithful ones shall bless You. They shall talk of the majesty of Your kingship, and speak of Your might, to make His mighty acts known among men and the majestic glory of His kingship. Your Kingship is an eternal kingship; Your dominion is for all generations. The Lord supports all who stumble, and makes all who are bent stand straight. The eyes of all look to You expectantly, and You give them their food when it is due. You give it openhandedly, feeding every creature to its heart’s content. The Lord is beneficent in all His ways and faithful in all His works. The Lord is near to all who call Him, to all who call Him with sincerity. He fulfills the wishes of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and delivers them. ",
        "2_Paragraph": "(And the prayer leader says half-Kaddish:) Exalted and sanctified be His great name (Amen) in the world which He created according to His will; and may He rule His kingdom, bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Messiah, (Amen) in your lifetime and in your days, and in the lifetime of the entire House of Israel, speedily and in the near future — and say Amen. (Amen) May His great name be blessed forever and for all eternity; blessed and praised, glorified, and exalted and uplifted, honored and elevated and extolled be the name of the Holy One, blessed be He; (Amen) above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations which we utter in the world — and say Amen. (Amen)",
        "3_Paragraph": "O man, why are you sleeping? Arise, call out with supplications! Pour out speech, seek forgiveness from the Master of masters. Run and be purified, and do not delay before the days pass on. And quickly run for help before the One who dwells in the [heavenly] abodes. And from rebellion and also evil, escape and fear disasters./ Please answer those who know Your name, the faithful Israel. To You Lord is charity, and to us is shamefacedness./ Stand like a man and be strong to confess sins. The Lord God seek with a serious head, to atone for rebellious sins. For never are unrevealed things hidden from Him. And every statement that is said is read in front of Him./ The merciful One, will have mercy like a father upon his children.",
        "4_Paragraph": "To you, Lord, is justice and to us is shamefacedness. How (lit., what) shall we complain and what shall we say? How can we speak and how can we justify ourselves? We will examine our ways and contemplate, and return to You. For Your right hand is extended, to accept the ones returning to You. They are returning to You with all their hearts; accept, in Your mercy, their beseeching. For Your great mercy we have come before You; like weak and impoverished people we have knocked on Your doors. On Your doors we have knocked, merciful and gracious One, do not let us return empty-handed from before You. From You, our King, do not send us back empty-handed; for You hear prayers. The One who hears prayers, to You all flesh shall come. The spirits shall come before You, and all of the souls. The soul and the body are Yours, spare Your work. The soul and the body are Yours, the Rock that none are like You, spare Your work. The soul and the body are Yours, do it for the sake of Your name. We have pleaded for Your name, do it for the sake of Your name. For the sake of Your name, for Your name is Gracious and Merciful King. Your name will be pronounced about us, Lord our God. Your name will be pronounced among us; do not put us aside, Lord our God. Our God, we are embarrassed of our actions and we are ashamed of our wrongdoings. We do not have a mouth to answer back, nor the temerity to lift up our head. For our backsliding has become great, we have sinned before You. We have sinned with our fathers, we have become criminals and wicked. What shall we say before You, the One who sits above; what will we say before the One who dwells up above? Do You not know what is hidden and revealed? You know the mysteries of the world, and what is hidden by every living being. You search the innermost parts of the abdomen; You see the kidneys and the heart. There is nothing that is lost before You, there is nothing that is concealed before Your eyes. If our sins have testified against us, Lord, do it for the sake of Your name. If You should hold on to sins, God, who will remain standing? For from You is forgiveness, so that You will be feared. For the source of life is with You, we shall see light by Your light. For it is not because of our righteousness that we cast our supplications before You, but it is rather from Your great mercy.",

        "11_Paragraph": "The tribe of Judah is in dire straits and in pain, does the lion [not] roar in the forest? They hope for Your salvation, the fathers and the children, poor and destitute. Stand in the breach, so that we not become a mockery; why, Lord, do You stand afar? Your doves have reached the gates of death; appear, the One who sits upon the cherubs. Bring us help from distress; is the hand of the Lord too short? Renew our days in the old exile; awake, why do You sleep? Remember Your children in a land not theirs, so that a stranger not approach them. The hidden end, reveal to the lonely one; Zion shall rejoice, the daughters of Judah shall be gladdened.
