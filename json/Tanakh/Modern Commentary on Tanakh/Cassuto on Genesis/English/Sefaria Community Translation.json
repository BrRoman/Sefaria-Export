It is more probable that the reference is to western Semitic tribes described as Kwshhw in the second collection of Egyptian execration texts which date back to the second half of the nineteenth century BCE. It appears that these tribes dwelled in the south of the land of Israel or of Jordan and were eventually absorbed by Midian (compare, <i>a <b>Kushite</b> woman</i>, in Numbers 12:1; and the mention of <b>Kushan</b> parallel to <b>Midian</b> in Habakkuk 3:7)."
