                "[24] It turns out that [the Torah] has four sons: one wise, one stupid, one wicked, and one who does not know how to ask. The wise son, what does he say? “What are the testimonies, statutes that the Lord our God has commanded us?” (Deut 6:20) So you should open for him the laws of Pesah. Say to him: “[After eating] the Paschal lamb, one does not follow up with the afikomen.” The stupid son, “saying ‘What is this?’ And you should say to him: ‘With a strong hand God took us out of Egypt’” (Exod 13:14).  The wicked son says: “What is this service to you?” Since he excluded himself from the whole you should exclude him from the whole. Say to him, “‘because of what God did for me’ (Exod 13:8)—me and not you, if you had been there, you would not have been redeemed.” And the one who doesn’t know to ask: you open with him, as it says, “And you shall tell your child on that day, ‘Because of this the LORD acted for me when I came out of Egypt.’” (Exod 13:8)."
