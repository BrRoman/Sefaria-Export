And the fact that she is impure (unkosher) even because of her kindness, I heard those who say that it is because she only performs kindness to her friends. And the source for these words is in the Chiddushei HaRim on the Torah."

Behold, on its own, it is a depressing act. Those tablets the reception of which they anticipated for 49 days (plus another 40 days when Mosheh our teacher was on Mount Sinai) from their time of leaving Egypt were broken before their eyes--without it being pleasing that they would receive others in their stead, and it is curious therefore that RaShY would conclude his commentary on the Torah with mentioning this event. But perhaps it is possible that here there is some sort of connection from the end of the Torah to its beginning. There is creation, and there is deconstruction in which there is some kind of creation, in the sense of \"deconstructing the old is construction\" (Babylonian Talmud, Megillah 31b). Is it not possible that the golden calf and the tablets could have come into being folded into a single moment--and that therefore in the breaking of the tablets there was a sort of construction of a proper reality.
