        "87_Daf, 12_Line, 2_Comment": "Of Bayah the tax-collector - It once happened that Jewish tax-farmer, evil, and a great scholar died on the same day and in the same place. All the people assembled to attend the burial of the great scholar; at the same time the relatives of the tax-farmer brought his bier for burial. Enemies attacked the group, so they all dropped both biers and ran. One student however stayed there guarding the body of his rabbi. Some time later the town dignitaries returned to resume the burial of the great scholar, but the biers of the rabbi and the tax-farmer somehow got exchanged and the protests of the student were of no avail. So the relatives of the tax-farmer buried the great rabbi, which greatly distressed the student; nor could he explain to himself what great sin had caused the one to be buried in such a shameful way and what great merit in the other had brought about his interment with such honor. His rabbi appeared to him in a dream and told him not to be distressed. \"Come and let me show you how greatly I am honored in paradise and let me also show you that man in hell with the hinges of the gates of hell turning through his ears. Once I heard people calumniating the sages and did not protest (and that is why I was punished); he once prepared a banquet in honor of a city dignitary who did not show up, and he distributed the food to the poor (and that is why he was rewarded).\" The student asked how long the poor man was doomed to suffer such difficult judgment. \"Until Shimeon ben Shatach dies,\" was the reply, \"who will then replace him!\" \"Why?\" asked the student; \"Because there are Jewish women in Ashkelon who practice witchcraft and he does not subject them to judgment.\" The following day the student related his dream to Shimeon ben Shatach. The latter assembled eighty tall young men and distributed to each of them a jar with a cloak wrapped up inside (it was a rainy day). He also told them to make sure that they were always eighty in number. \"When you come inside,\" he said, \"one of you must raise his jar from the ground; from that moment the witches will have no further hold over you; if that does not work then we can never beat them.\" Shimeon ben Shatach went into the witches' hall and left the young men outside. When the witches asked him who he was he replied that he was a wizard who had come to test them with his wizardry. \"What tricks can you do?\" they asked. \"Despite the fact that it is raining today I can produce eighty young men with dry talitot!\" \"Show us!\" He went outside and beckoned the young men inside. They removed the talitot from the jars, put them on, and came in. They took each man one witch and carried them, and were able to defeat them, and hung them all up. The relatives of the witches were incensed. Two of them came forward and perjured themselves by testifying that Shimeon ben-Shatach's son had committed some crime that was punishable by death. He was condemned to death. As he was being taken out to be stoned he said, \"If I am guilty of this crime may my death bring me atonement, and if I am innocent may it atone for all my other sins and the responsibility for my death will be on the shoulders of the witnesses.\" When the perjurers heard this they recanted their testimony and explained that they had only acted because of their animosity at the fate of their women-folk, and so he wasn't killed.",

It is possible that one can derive the person's liability [to the death penalty for intention for idol worship in a different service while performing a service] from there as well. Thus one must say that [the verse's mention of] \"slaughtering\" is indeed superfluous.

Moshe said to the Holy One 'You have done evil to this people! Now if they don't have bricks they place the children of Israel into the building!' The Holy One replied to him, 'They are wiping out the thorns, because it is revealed before Me that if these children lived they would be completely wicked. If you want, make a test and remove one.' Moshe went and removed Micah."
