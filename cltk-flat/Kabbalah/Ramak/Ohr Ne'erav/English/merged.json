        "0_Introduction, 1_Paragraph": "In the late summer of 1587, Moses Cordovero’s treatise <i>Or Ne’erav</i> (“The Pleasant Light”) was published in Venice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It was published by “The House of Juan Di Gara.” An annotation on the last page indicates that the typesetting was completed on the thirteenth of Av, 5347. On the publisher, see A. M. Haberman, <i>Ha-Madpis Juan di Gara u-Reshimat Sifrei Beyt Defuso,</i> ed. Y. Yudlov (Lod, 1982).</i> It was a book with several aims. First of all, it was written as a justification for the study of Kabbalah. As well, it contained detailed instructions for beginners on how to commence their Kabbalistic studies. Finally, it constituted an epitome of Cordovero’s great systematic theology of Kabbalah entitled <i>Pardes Rimmonim</i> (“The Pomegranate Orchard”), which as yet remained in manuscript.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pardes Rimmonim</i> was first printed in Lublin in 1592.</i> Taken as a whole, <i>Or Ne’erav</i> was clearly meant to serve as an elementary text for beginners in Kabbalah. It was also obviously intended as a means toward the popularization of a Judaic world-view which, at least at its inception, had been conceived as an esoteric interpretation of Torah, not meant for the ordinary person.",
        "0_Introduction, 2_Paragraph": "Historians of Judaism have long seen the sixteenth century as a pivotal period in the development of Kabbalah. The position maintained by Gershom Scholem, that prior to the sixteenth century Kabbalah belonged to relatively small groups of masters and their disciples, who had little desire to propagate their ideas among the masses, has recently been challenged.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Gershom Scholem, <i>Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism,</i> p. 244. Cf. Mark Verman, “Mysticism, Indoctrination and Society.”</i> However, Scholem’s emphasis on the centrality for Kabbalah of the sixteenth century, “with its programme of bringing its doctrines home to the community,” retains its essential validity whether or not one also agrees that this program had as its ultimate purpose “preparing [the community] for the coming of the messiah.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scholem, <i>Major Trends,</i> p. 250.</i> In particular, Scholem’s point that the ethical (<i>musar</i>) literature of Judaism prior to the sixteenth century shows little trace of Kabbalistic influence, whereas from the sixteenth century onward such works openly reflect the ethos of Kabbalah, is well taken.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid., p. 251.</i> The reservations expressed by Moshe Idel on important parts of Scholem’s presentation of sixteenth-century Kabbalah have left this point unchallenged.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Idel, “One from a Town, Two from a Clan.”</i>",
        "0_Introduction, 3_Paragraph": "Despite this recognition, the details of the change that was brought about in the position of Kabbalah in the sixteenth century among the broad masses of Jews have been relatively ignored by scholarship. This is at least in part because the concentration of most scholars of Kabbalah on what might be called the academic aspects of Kabbalistic thought has led to a situation in which the popularization of Kabbalah in the sixteenth century has been relatively ignored.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Exceptions to this rule include Louis Jacobs, <i>The Palm Tree of Deborah,</i> and Lawrence Fine, <i>Safed Spirituality</i>.</i> This book, which offers an annotated English translation of the treatise <i>Or Ne’erav,</i> seeks to shed light on the process by which the Kabbalah was to become the possession of every literate Jew.",
        "0_Introduction, 4_Paragraph": "<b>Kabbalah</b>",
        "0_Introduction, 5_Paragraph": "The Hebrew term <i>kabbalah</i> refers to a body of knowledge “received” through a chain of transmission believed by rabbinic Jews to extend all the way back to the divine revelation at Sinai.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Mishnah, Avot 1:1.</i> Rabbinic Judaism, the dominant interpretation of Judaism in the medieval and early modern era, assumed as an essential belief that this body of knowledge, called <i>torah</i> (“teaching”), encompassed two divisions—one written, the other oral. The written Torah consisted of the Pentateuch, while the oral Torah contained an authoritative interpretation of the laws and the narrative in the written Torah. Rabbinic Jews further believed that the oral Torah, which had been transmitted in unwritten form from master to disciple for well over a millennium, had begun to be reduced to writing in the form of the Mishnah, which was edited by Rabbi Judah the Patriarch in the second century C.E. The process was continued by the editing of other collections of rabbinic traditions, including the Tosefta, the Gemara in its Palestinian and Babylonian recensions, and numerous collections of midrashim.",
        "0_Introduction, 6_Paragraph": "The fact that these collections of traditions, designed to be transmitted orally, had been reduced to writing was of concern to rabbinic Jews. Their major conclusion was that the oral traditions had been written down in response to extraordinary circumstances endangering the survival of the oral Torah in its original form of transmission. Maimonides, in the introduction to his code of Judaic law, the <i>Mishneh Torah,</i> states the issue clearly:",
        "0_Introduction, 7_Paragraph": "Why did our teacher [Rabbi Judah] the Patriarch [write down the Mishnah] and not leave matters as they were? [It was] because he observed that the number of disciples was diminishing, fresh calamities were continually occurring, the wicked kingdom [of Rome] was extending its domain and increasing in power, and Israelites were wandering and emigrating to distant countries. Therefore he composed a work to serve as a handbook for all, the contents of which could be rapidly studied and not be forgotten.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah,</i> introduction.</i>",
        "0_Introduction, 8_Paragraph": "In other words, the writing down of the oral Torah was a response to a perceived threat to the “natural” transmission of the Torah. The writing of other rabbinic collections was seen in a similar light.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ibid. It is noteworthy in this connection that Maimonides relates the writing of his halakhic compendium to his perception of a crisis in the transmission of Torah in his time.</i>",
        "0_Introduction, 9_Paragraph": "It should not be thought, however, that the process of writing down the oral Torah meant that the oral Torah had ceased to exist. Indeed for most Jews there remained within the realm of Torah room for aspects of the Torah which had not been “published.” These continued to be the exclusive province of oral transmission, or, if written, were written in such a way as to be virtually unintelligible and hence in need of oral reinforcement and explanation. Thus the Mishnah, in tractate Ḥagigah, refers to several aspects of Torah, including the sexual taboos (<i>‘arayot</i>), the Account of Creation, and the Account of the Chariot, which were not to be expounded publicly.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Mishnah, Ḥagigah 2:1.</i> The Torah, in other words, still held back certain secrets for oral transmission from master to disciple.",
        "0_Introduction, 10_Paragraph": "The notion that the Torah still had secrets to reveal became an extremely useful concept when, in the medieval period, Judaism— as well as Islam and Christianity—came into serious intellectual contact with the heritage of the science and philosophy of the ancient Greco-Roman world. For Jews, one of the major shifts which ensued from this contact was the necessity of dealing with the numerous passages in the Hebrew Bible and rabbinic literature which presented God in anthropomorphic terms. By the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the idea that the anthropomorphic passages in the Bible might be understood literally, while still sincerely believed by many Jews, had become severely problematic for Maimonides and others who took seriously the philosophical proofs for the incorporeality of God. Thus Maimonides equated with atheists, polytheists, and idolaters those who believed in one God but held that God possessed a body and an image.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides, <i>Mishneh Torah,</i> Hilkhot Teshuvah 3:7. Cf. Rabad’s animadversion to this statement, defending the “authenticity” of Jews who persist in anthropomorphic beliefs.</i>",
        "0_Introduction, 11_Paragraph": "In order to deal with the implications of the seeming contradictions between the literal sense of the Bible and the findings of science, Maimonides and other medieval Jewish rationalists were compelled to assert that the Torah spoke “in human language”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Marvin Fox, <i>Interpreting Maimonides: Studies in Methodology, Meta-physics and Moral Philosophy</i> (Chicago, 1990), p. 240.</i> concerning the deity and, therefore, that the words of the Torah, insofar as they indicated things which were “scientifically” impossible—such as attributing human bodily parts or emotions to God—were not to be taken literally but, rather, interpreted metaphorically.",
        "0_Introduction, 12_Paragraph": "The need to maintain a nonliteral interpretation of the Torah was widely felt among medieval Jewish intellectuals. However, the rationalist interpretations of Maimonides and others were not as widely accepted. In the first place, rationalistic philosophy was a discipline which was demonstrably non-Jewish in origin. Despite attempts to give it a Judaic pedigree,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Maimonides, <i>Guide of the Perplexed</i> 1.71. Cf. Isaac Husik, <i>A History of Mediaeval Jewish Philosophy</i> (New York, 1973), p. xvi.</i> the knowledge that philosophy was a foreign importation doubtless tended to lessen its acceptance. Secondly, and far more importantly, philosophy was hard pressed to explain the difference between the remote God of the philosophers, who had no interest in things that were not eternal, such as human beings, and the Biblical God, who played an active role in humankind’s affairs and most particularly in those of His people, Israel. Furthermore, Jewish philosophers often found it hard to explain satisfactorily the details of the legislation in the Torah. Maimonides’ historical explanations of such things as the prohibition of mingling linen and woolen threads (<i>sha’atnez</i>) may have satisfied some, but doubtless left others wondering whether such formulations did not tend to relativize the Torah’s commandments and potentially threaten the continued observance of Torah law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Ira Robinson, “Halakha, Kabbala and Philosophy in the Thought of Joseph Jabez,” p. 393.</i>",
        "0_Introduction, 13_Paragraph": "In contrast with this, Kabbalah offered its adherents a means whereby the Torah in its entirety could be satisfactorily explained in a nonliteralist manner. The details of the commandments no less than their general principles could be understood by referring to Kabbalistic doctrines.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the Kabbalistic interpretation of the commandments, see Daniel Matt, “The Mystic and the Mizvot,” and Elliot Wolfson, “Mystical Rationalization of the Commandments in <i>Sefer ha-Rimmon,</i>” pp. 222, 249-251.</i> Moreover, care was taken to present the ideas of Kabbalah in such a way as to ensure that they would appear to be entirely intrinsic to the rabbinic tradition. Thus the first major Kabbalistic work, <i>Sefer ha-Bahir,</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the Midrashic nature of the <i>Bahir,</i> see Gershom Scholem, <i>Origins of the Kabbalah,</i> pp. 39-44, 49-53, and Joseph Dan, “Midrash and the Dawn of Kabbalah,” pp. 127-139.</i> as well as Kabbalah’s major thirteenth-century exposition, the Zohar,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the Zohar’s Midrashic approach, see Itamar Gruenwald, “From Talmudic to Zoharic Hermeneutics.”</i> presented themselves as Midrashic expositions of the Torah—in other words, as works in a classical genre.",
        "0_Introduction, 14_Paragraph": "Kabbalah, which first emerged into the light of day in twelfth-century Provence, and which received its classical statement in the Zohar, in thirteenth-century Spain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">On the Zohar, see Scholem, <i>Major Trends,</i> pp. 156-243; Daniel Matt, <i>Zohar,</i> introduction; and Yehuda Liebes, “How the Zohar Was Written.”</i> understood God’s relationship with the created universe in the following way.",
        "0_Introduction, 15_Paragraph": "God, in His most fundamental reality, is unknown to man and, in principle, unknowable. The only thing known about God in this fundamental reality is His existence. Kabbalists called the God of this fundamental reality Eyn Sof, meaning “without limit,” or even ‘Ayin (“nothingness”), signifying that from the perspective of mankind, there was “nothing” that one could know about Him.",
        "0_Introduction, 16_Paragraph": "Eyn Sof initiated a process which the Kabbalists called Aẓilut (“emanation”), which eventuated in a system of ten sefirot. The sefirot, taken as a whole, represented God as experienced by human beings. The following is a somewhat simplified depiction of the process. The first sefirah to be emanated, called Keter (“crown”), marked the transition point between Eyn Sof and the sefirotic system. The next two sefirot, Ḥokhmah (“wisdom”) and Binah (“understanding”), represented a male and a female principle, respectively. Ḥokhmah and Binah, in union, produced the seven other sefirot, Gedulah (“greatness”) or Raḥamim (“mercy”), Gevurah (“might”), Tiferet (“glory”), Neẓaḥ (“triumph”), Hod (“splendor”), Yesod (“foundation”), and Malkhut (“kingdom”). The three upper sefirot, Keter, Ḥokhmah, and Binah, were considered relatively less accessible to the human mind than the lower seven, which were taken to represent the sometimes diametrically opposed qualities attributed to God in the Hebrew Bible and the rabbinic literature. Thus God the Merciful was seen as represented by the sefirah Gedulah. God’s attribute of stern justice was embodied in the sefirah Gevurah. Tiferet was the synthesis between mercy and justice.",
        "0_Introduction, 17_Paragraph": "Though the Kabbalists asserted that all of the sefirot were interrelated and, indeed, that all were One, nonetheless they tended to concentrate their attention on the relationship between two sefirot in particular: Tiferet and Malkhut. Tiferet was seen as the central sefirah and a male principle. Ideally, it was to enter into union with Malkhut, a female principle which marked the point of transition between the realm of the sefirot and the created universe. Through the union of Tiferet and Malkhut flowed the divine energy which created and sustained the universe. When the Tiferet-Malkhut union was consummated, the flow of divine energy was unabated. When the union was interrupted, however, the flow of divine energy ceased sustaining the universe and, instead, served to strengthen the forces of cosmic evil, referred to as the “Other Side” (Sitra A“ra), and conceived as arrayed in a counter-sefirotic structure.",
        "0_Introduction, 18_Paragraph": "Where Kabbalists found themselves divided was on the question of whether the sefirot, taken as a whole, constituted an “instrument” employed by God for His revelation to His creatures or whether, in fact, the sefirotic realm <i>was</i> God.",
        "0_Introduction, 19_Paragraph": "Within this divine economy, human beings, and especially the Jews, were not mere passive observers. Kabbalists held that Jews, through their performance of the commandments of the Torah and through their prayers, could influence the sefirotic realm. Prayer and Torah observance, undertaken with the correct intention, would align the sefirot correctly and help accomplish the union of Tiferet and Malkhut. Sin, on the other hand, served to disrupt the harmony of the sefirot, sunder the sefirotic union, and render aid and comfort to the evil forces of the Other Side.",
        "0_Introduction, 20_Paragraph": "The responsibility of the individual Jew for the well-being of the cosmos was coupled with a belief that events and actions in the human sphere indicated corresponding processes in the sefirotic realm. Thus each earthly action had its sefirotic counterpart. For the Kabbalist, this meant that literally everything was to be related to the divine and was to be understood in a sense beyond its surface meaning.",
        "0_Introduction, 21_Paragraph": "For its adherents, Kabbalah was clearly a tool of great power and sophistication with which to understand the universe. It was just as clearly the ultimate secret of the Torah. This being so, it was by no means clear whether this secret doctrine was to be publicized to wider circles or not.",
        "0_Introduction, 22_Paragraph": "Those who wished to teach Kabbalistic doctrines, and, in particular, those who desired to reach a mass audience, were faced with a seemingly unsolvable problem. They were fully convinced that their discipline was none other than <i>Ma’aseh Merkavah,</i> the esoteric lore referred to in the Mishnah. Thus they were seemingly bound by the Mishnah’s prohibition against expounding this material “before even one student.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. n. 11 above.</i>",
        "0_Introduction, 23_Paragraph": "In this spirit, one of the first major Kabbalistic masters in twelfth-century Provence, Isaac the Blind, went on record in a letter to Spain against the indiscriminate spread of Kabbalah through public exposition and the composition of Kabbalistic treatises that might fall into the “wrong” hands. His remarks were addressed to circles of students of Kabbalah in Spain who were composing Kabbalistic treatises and even, like Naḥmanides, incorporating Kabbalistic indications in a commentary on the Torah meant for the general public.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Scholem, <i>Origins of the Kabbalah,</i> pp. 393-394. On Nahmanides’ Kabbalistic doctrines, see Moshe Idel, “We Have No Tradition on This,” and Elliot Wolfson, “By Way of Truth.”</i>",
        "0_Introduction, 24_Paragraph": "Those Kabbalists, from the thirteenth through the fifteenth century, who did engage in the writing of Kabbalistic works, generally did so in full consciousness of the fact that they were addressing audiences whose members could not all be trusted with the secrets of the Torah which they were purveying. For this reason they often sought to conceal as well as reveal, in order to make sure that oral direction would still be needed in addition to the written treatises. Thus Abraham ben Eliezer Halevi, a Kabbalist of the generation of the Spanish Expulsion, asserted in one of his works that Kabbalistic authors invariably omitted certain elements from their writings in order to maintain the need for the Kabbalah to be transmitted orally.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Ira Robinson, “Abraham Ben Eliezer Halevi,” p. 198, nn. 21-23. For a similar warning on the inherent danger of delving into the mysteries of Kabbalah without a master and relying solely on what is written in books, see Nahmanides, <i>Derush ‘al Kohelet,</i> in <i>Kilve ha-Rumhan,</i> ed. C. Chavel (Jerusalem, Mossad ha-Rav Kook, 1963), vol. 1, p. 180.</i> Given this approach, one can easily appreciate the extent to which those desiring to popularize Kabbalah had to overcome an ingrained opposition to its widespread dissemination even on the part of Kabbalists, let alone opponents of the discipline. This fact, in addition to the painstaking effort, mentioned earlier, to present the Kabbalah as wholly intrinsic to the Judaic tradition, went a long way toward reducing the expressed opposition to Kabbalah to relatively minor proportions. There were, indeed, Jews who objected vigorously to Kabbalah, for instance on the grounds that the tenfold character of the sefirot could not be reconciled with God’s absolute unity. Apparently, however, these objections were relatively few, perhaps consonant with the limited distribution of Kabbalah within Jewry.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. Idel, <i>Kabbalah,</i> p. 3.</i>",
        "0_Introduction, 25_Paragraph": "It is thus reasonably clear that the process whereby Kabbalah came to the attention of the Jewish public in its first centuries was slow, halting, and somewhat ambivalent.",
        "0_Introduction, 26_Paragraph": "This situation began to change in the sixteenth century. In the aftermath of the expulsion from the Iberian peninsula in the 1490s, an upheaval which had the same sort of resonance for Jews of that generation as the Holocaust has for ours, Kabbalah began going public in a big way. Kabbalistic works like the Zohar began to be printed, amid a major controversy regarding the propriety of printing them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Isaiah Tishby, “Ha-Pulmus ‘al <i>Sefer ha-Zoḥar</i> be-Me’ah ha-Shesh Esreh be-Italiyah.”</i>",
        "0_Introduction, 27_Paragraph": "More importantly, systematic treatises on Kabbalah began to appear. One of these comprehensive guides to Kabbalah was written by the aforementioned Abraham ben Eliezer Halevi. Entitled <i>Massoret ha-Ḥokhmah</i> (“Tradition of Wisdom”), it was a defense of the discipline of Kabbalah against its detractors, a condemnation of opposing Kabbalistic schools, and a praise of the benefits deriving from the study of Kabbalah. However, the exposition of Kabbalistic doctrine in this work is brief and sketchy in the extreme.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Robinson, “Abraham ben Eliezer Halevi,” pp. 195-200.</i> Similar to Halevi’s work in scope, but somewhat more well known, because printed, is Judah Ḥayyat’s introduction to his commentary on <i>Ma’arekhet ha-Elohut</i> (“The System of Divinity”).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Judah Ḥayyat, commentary on <i>Ma’arekhet ha-Elohut</i> (Mantua, 1558), introduction.</i> On a much grander scale is the work of another contemporary, Meir ibn Gabbai, whose exposition of Kabbalah was entitled <i>‘Avodat ha-Kodesh</i> (“The Holy Service”).

        "0_Introduction, 29_Paragraph": "Most importantly, broad sections of the Jewish public began assimilating the Kabbalistic ethos into their own lives. Nowhere was this process more apparent than in the town of Safed, in the Galilee. After the Ottoman conquest of the Land of Israel in 1517, Safed attracted a large number of Jewish immigrants, largely from among the Spanish and Portuguese exiles and their children. These people settled in the Land of Israel partly because they sought to be in the place where they expected an imminent messianic redemption and partly because it was part of the burgeoning Ottoman Empire, to which many Jews were attracted at this time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf.

Several liturgical innovations, such as the preliminary service on the eve of the Sabbath (<i>kabbalat shabbat</i>) and the midnight penitential service (<i>tikkun ḥaẓẓot</i>) emanated from these circles and were accepted by Jews throughout the world.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">31</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf.

Because it contains no introduction by the author, we are unable to say with any certainty when it was written or why. From its contents, however, we can readily discern that Cordovero utilized his immense intellectual and pedagogical talents to create a work with a dual purpose. As his son, Gedaliah, who brought the book to press, indicates in his introduction, he abridged the material which was argued <i>in extenso</i> in <i>Pardes Rimmonim</i>. To this abridgement he added, at the beginning of the treatise, “additional chapters … to [cause others to] understand and to teach the usefulness of this discipline and the necessity for learning it.”<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Or Ne’erav,</i> p. 3a.</i> Thus, on the one hand, <i>Or Ne’erav</i> served as an argument for the legitimacy of Kabbalah and its study.

Ḥayyat’s treatment of this subject, though briefer than Cordovero’s, shows a number of interesting parallels with <i>Or Ne’erav</i>.</i> His treatment of his sources is unmistakably Cordoveran in its thoroughness and meticulousness but is nonetheless not terribly original. Indeed, it might even be said that some of the groups Cordovero argued against, such as those who entirely denied that the Torah could be interpreted esoterically, did not constitute a formal school of thought in his day and were included only in order to fill the spectrum of logical possibilities of opposition to his enterprise.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf. n. 20 above.

Cf. Zohar I, 23b. Cf. also n. 4 above.</i> There is no contradiction [here] since “psalm” and “prayer” refer to Malkhut in its two aspects. When one prays out of distress and need, then [Malkhut] is called “prayer,” since [in this instance] she bears the prayers of Israel on high. That is the essence of “prayer,” as is explained in that place and elsewhere. When a miracle is wrought for a man and he feels a need to say words of praise, then [Malkhut] is a “psalm” in the mystery of the miracle, which stems from Yesod [and] which brings her to union with Tiferet, which is called “praise” (<i>hallel</i>). Hence she is called “psalm” (<i>tehillah</i>), from the word “light,” as it is written, <i>When his lamp shone</i> (<i>be-hillo</i>) <i>upon my head</i> (Job 29:3). For she brings life to man through the miracle which is Yesod [stemming from] the “Tree of Life,” which is Tiferet, which [in turn] derives life from Binah, which is [also] called “psalm.” [Binah] is also [called] the <i>land of the living</i> (Ps. 142:6). Life [comes] from [Binah] through the force of Ḥokhmah, as it is written, <i>Wisdom</i> (<i>ḥokhmah</i>) <i>will give life to him who possesses it</i> (Eccles. 7:12).",

Thus their prayer [is meant] according to the literal meaning with regard to their enjoyment [of the pleasures] of this world. To such [worshippers], prayer [consists] of asking God for their sustenance in the lower [world]. However, there are children [of God] whose entire purpose in prayer is to unify Malkhut with Tiferet. This is the mystery  of “psalm” which he interpreted as partaking of the mystery of “praise” (<i>hallel</i>).

They stated, “However, he who reveals mysteries [of the Torah] to the wicked,” and afterwards stated, “He who reveals to them … causes … the righteous.” Why did [the passage] not say “reveals the genitals of the Torah,” as was stated above? Alternatively, let it say in the first instance “causes the Righteous.” Why are there two differing [versions]?",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 8_Paragraph": "2. It states, “causes.” However, the word “causes” is not exact. It ought to have stated, “makes the righteous,” for this is the very one who causes damage above.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 9_Paragraph": "3. “At that time the righteous below.” What is the reason for all this exposition? The remaining linguistic points will be covered in the commentary, with God’s help.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 10_Paragraph": "The reason that [the passage] declared, “Those who possess these qualities” is that they denote people in possession of the qualities of the righteous kings, seers, [and] prophets, masters of Torah, heroes [who are] pious, understanding, [and] wise; chiefs of the thousands of Israel. It was stated there that [the secrets of Torah] must be revealed to those who are the embodiment of these [sefirotic] qualities, occupy themselves with the commandments related to them, and whose souls are emanated from  them. In other words there exists an obligation for one [who knows] to reveal the deep mysteries to them. In order to prove this obligation on the part of the knowledgeable person to teach one who fears [God], [the author] dealt with the opposite [situation] and derived the [positive] commandment from the prohibition [against teaching one who does not possess these qualities]. [The passage] states, “However, he who reveals mysteries [of the Torah] to the wicked,” meaning that he reveals “the genitals of the Torah.” In other words, Torah is [the sefirah] Tiferet. He who spreads the mysteries of the Torah among the wicked sins. For through Tiferet he spreads it to the “outside” ones, God forbid.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Evil gets its power from the same divine source as the sefirot. Since it would not derive power from divine emanation in the ordinary course of events, it must contrive to “steal” power from the sefirotic system, the rightful recipient.</i> All the power of the wicked derives from the <i>kelipot</i>. Thus he who teaches him teaches the <i>kelipot</i>! This [teacher] spreads the mysteries of the Torah, which is Tiferet, and thus reveals the nakedness of the Torah “for the sons of … the maidservant.” The intention is to demonstrate how the wicked and the <i>kelipah</i> are as one, and though the wicked is the son of Lilith, the evil maidservant, it is all one—mother and children. For the soul of the wicked and the strength of his wickedness stem from his mother, the maidservant. Thus we have demonstrated how the king [Tiferet] strengthens and influences the “maidservant.” That is the meaning of “genitals of the Torah.” He who reveals mysteries [of the Torah] to the wicked actually does this!",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 11_Paragraph": "As well, he has caused another action, “the departure of the flow [of emanation] from Yesod.” Because the king is cohabiting with the “maidservant” [Lilith], God forbid, he does not consort with the “mistress” [Malkhut]. It is thus accepted that [the wicked teacher] causes the removal of the flow [of emanation] from Tiferet to Yesod, since [Tiferet] is doing nothing other than cohabiting with the “outside” ones. Thus it would appear that he could not consort with the “inner” ones, the righteous Yesod, God forbid.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 12_Paragraph": "All this teaches that the mysteries of the Torah abide in Yesod. Thus [the sefirah] is called Yesod, [a combination of] the <i>yod</i> of the covenant and mystery <i>[sod],</i> which is the mystery of the Torah. Proof for this is [derived from the verse], <i>The secret of the Lord is for those who fear Him; and His covenant to make them know it</i> (Ps. 25:14). Thus “covenant” and “mystery” are as one. All this demonstrates that when mysteries [of the Torah] are spread among the “outside” ones, they are removed from the “inner” ones.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 13_Paragraph": "“The departure of the flow [of emanation]  from [Yesod].” Thus the source of Yesod, which is Tiferet, removes itself, as has been explained. Since there is no [flow of] emanation in Yesod, he does not consort with Malkhut, as was said.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 14_Paragraph": "“And from the Shekhinah.” The proof from Scripture is <i>the water left the sea</i>. This means that the reason for the lack of water in the sea, which is Malkhut, is because the river, which is Yesod, <i>is dry and parched</i>. This proves that during the time that the “river” is dry, there can be no water in the “sea,” for it can receive no influx except through Yesod. Thus when [Tiferet] is separated from Yesod, it is likewise separated from the Shekhinah.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 15_Paragraph": "“At that time the righteous below.” A difficulty [which might be posed] is that [the passage] stated that because [the teacher] reveals mysteries [of the Torah] to the wicked, <i>the river is dry,</i> indicating that there will be no emanation at all. However, this is not exact. [The passage should] rather [state] that there will be no mysteries [to be found] in Malkhut since that [teacher] spread the mysteries to the “outside.” Why, then, should not the remaining [sefirotic] degrees of emanation receive their influx? That [possible difficulty] is why [the passage] specified “the departure of the flow,” indicating that there is no emanation at all. There is proof [from this passage] that there is no emanation or flow at all. [This situation] is caused by those people below who are impoverished both in body and in the mysteries of Torah. This indicates the absolute removal of emanation. They are thus absolutely impoverished.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 16_Paragraph": "After [the passage] dealt with the sin of one who reveals [mysteries] to the wicked, one can understand the opposite—the eminence of the righteous, <i>for also this opposite, that did God make</i> (Eccles. 7:14). [Thus] “those who reveal mysteries to the righteous cause the righteous.” By revealing the mystery to the righteous, [the teacher] causes emanation from the source on high, which is Tiferet, to Yesod. Thereupon Yesod clarifies these mysteries [in passing them] to Malkhut. This is [why the passage] states “cause the righteous,” which is Yesod, “enlightenment in the mysteries of the Torah,” which is the mystery of the emanation from Tiferet, termed “Torah,” to the Shekhinah. This is its path.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 17_Paragraph": "[The passage] states “cause” and not “enlighten” because what is happening is that the “righteous” himself enlightens  the aspect of [one] who is righteous like him. Indeed “enlightenment in the mysteries of the Torah,” from Tiferet to Malkhut, is caused naturally, since a good quality increases and spreads of itself.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 18_Paragraph": "“Light and mystery.” This is problematic, because “mystery” rightly resides in Yesod, as was proven above. [However,] if this is true, how can these “mysteries” [also] stem from Tiferet? This [question] is why [the passage] stated that “light,” which certainly resides in Tiferet, is called “mystery” [<i>raz</i>] and is numerically equivalent to “light” [<i>or</i>]. Therefore “mystery” can reside in Tiferet, except that in Tiferet it resides in the recondite aspect of “light,” which is subtle, whereas in Yesod it partakes of the aspect of secret, which is more open and [able to be] revealed through the process of emanation.",
        "3_PART III, 1_, 3_Chapter, 19_Paragraph": "The fact is that the [sefirah] Binah, which is above Tiferet, consists of one light. Binah influences the <i>vav</i> [of the Tetragrammaton] in the mystery of <i>resh,</i> which is Malkhut, the beginning [<i>reshit</i>] of the lower [beings]. Since the eminence of the revealer of mysteries is so great, he is obliged to entreat the “righteous” to reveal his secrets to him. This is [the meaning of] what was said at the beginning of the passage above, “One must reveal deep mysteries to those.” The phrasing implies necessity and obligation, as is known.",

It was made clear innumerable times in the <i>Tikkunim</i> that the eminence of the masters of Kabbalah is much greater [than that] of the masters of Scripture and of Mishnah.

Thus, since the mystery of Scripture inheres in the mystery of the lowest garment of Torah—the stories—[the master of Scripture’s] flow of emanation derives solely from the place of “Making.” One who occupies himself with Mishnah—that is, the six Orders of Mishnah, consisting of a commentary on the concealed [matters] in the physical Torah and similar matters of [scriptural] exposition—partakes of the mystery of “Formation,” as is made clear there. Therefore he derives his flow [of emanation] from the [World] above that of “Making,” which is “Formation.” The masters of Kabbalah receive more [emanation] from the mystery of the innermost garment, the soul [of Torah] that clothes itself in the commandments, which is the secret of the [World of] “Creation.” [Even] the enlightened will be unable to comprehend this matter unless he first examines the book <i>Pardes [Rimmonim]</i> in the section Abya.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Pardes Rimmonim,</i> sec. 16.</i> In that place, we have [discussed this matter] at length with God’s help.",
