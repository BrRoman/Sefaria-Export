                "Ezra ordained ten ordinances: That they read from the Torah during the afternoon prayers on Shabbat for the sake of craftsmen who do not have the free time to listen to the reading of the Torah on Mondays and Thursdays, as we read on Mondays and Thursdays. As the first ones ordained reading on Mondays and Thursdays, one man [reading] three verses or three men [reading] three verses, corresponding to the priests, the Levites, and the Israelites. [This was] so that Jews not go three days without reading from the Torah, based on the hint: <i>they traveled three days in the wilderness and found no water</i> (Exodus 15:22). And they ordained reading on Mondays and Thursday since it is a time of goodwill. As we say in the Midrash that Moses went up to receive the second tablets on Thursday and came down on Monday. And that is why we proliferate supplications on Mondays and Thursdays, and it is likewise practiced to fast on them. Then Ezra came and ordained ten verses for three men corresponding to the ten idle men [assigned to be so in order to ensure a prayer quorum]. And that they should adjudicate on Thursdays and Mondays since they would be present, as they come to read from the Book. And that they should do laundry on Thursday to honor the Shabbat by wearing [clean] white clothes, whereas there is no free time on the eve of Shabbat to do laundry. And that they should eat garlic on the eve of Shabbat, since Shabbat is the time for the set conjugal time, as it is stated: <i>And the Children of Israel kept the Shabbat</i> (Exodus 31:16) — the first letters of which are <i>biah</i> [intercourse]. And women are included. And garlic proliferates seed. And that a woman rise up early and bake during the day, when she wants to bake so that bread be present for the poor. And that a woman bind herself with an apron on account of modesty. And that a woman first scrub herself, and then immerse, on account of intervening substances [between her skin and the water of the ritual bath]. That peddlers go around in the cities and that the peddlers of the city may not prevent them [from doing so] on account of [accessibility of] women's jewelry so that the daughters of Israel not seem disgusting to their husbands. And he ordained immersion for men with nocturnal emissions for prayer and Torah study. But today the practice is like those three elders, as we say in the chapter [entitled] Reishit HaGez (Chullin), 136b, and in the chapter [entitled] Mi SheMeto (Berakhot 22a): Like Rabbi Yehudah ben Betira regarding words of Torah, as he said, \"Words of Torah do not absorb impurity.\" And also [another possibility] — he had made it conditional, that anyone who wants to annul it may come and annul it, as we say at the beginning of Moed Katan Page 3b concerning that of Rabban Gamliel and his court, \"They gathered and took a count against these two chapters and permitted them.\" And also [another possibility] — the practice did not spread with most of the Jewish people, as we say concerning barrels of wines in the chapter [entitled] Ain Maamidin (Avodah Zarah 36a)..."
