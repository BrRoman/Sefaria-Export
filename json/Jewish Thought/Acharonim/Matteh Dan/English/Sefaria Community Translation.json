Molekh was part of the category of idolatry. So why was it singled out?

However, since we did not find in the Torah that part of a day is holy and part of a day mundane, but rather that all of our holidays, our [new] moons, and our Shabbats are from one evening to the next evening, we must make one month lacking with 29 days, and one month full with 30. Let's assume that Adar is the lacking one and we have set Rosh Chodesh [the first day of the month of] Nissan on the thirtieth day of it. If so, the first half of the thirtieth day is Adar, and the latter half is Nissan. So Rosh Chodesh Nissan does not really start until this latter half. Yet we are compelled to sanctify the whole day for the reason that we mentioned. And that is [the meaning of] that which the sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Chapter 1 in Megillah 5a), \"You count days for months, and you do not count hours.\"\n"

And when these hours over two or three years are joined together, we add them to the month of Cheshvan.
