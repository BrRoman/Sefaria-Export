            "<b>Due to the sin of vows unfulfilled, a man’s wife dies:</b> It appears to me, with the help of the Heavens, [that] it is measure for measure [poetic justice]. This one disparages vows, since they are with speech, saying, \"What have I done? They are only words!\" Hence his wife — who was made into his wife by speech when he said to her, \"Behold, you are consecrated to me\" — shall die. As according to his opinion, it also [follows that] this one is not his wife! That is why she will leave his home and separate from him. Or it can be understood, with the help of the Heavens, according to that which Rabbi [Yaakov Reischer, author of] Shevut Yaakov wrote in the name of the Sefer HaKaneh, \"One who makes a vow but does not fulfill it will come back reincarnated as a woman, and a woman who makes a vow but does not fulfill it will come back reincarnated as a gentile.\" See there. And that is why one who makes a vow and does not fulfill it will have his wife die. As it is being hinted to him that a wife can only be had by a man. And since he did not fulfill [the vow], he will perforce be reincarnated as a woman, so he is considered a woman [already] from now. So why does he have a wife in his household?! That is why she is removed from him.",
            "<b>Due to the sin of vows unfulfilled, children die when they are young:</b> It can be asked — from where do we [know ] it is when they are young from this verse [<i>Do not permit your mouth to bring guilt on your flesh, nor say before the angel that it was an error; why should God be angered by your voice, and destroy the work of your hands</i>]? But it appears to me, with the help of the Heavens, that he learns it out from the extraneous language of the verse. As it states, <i>and destroy the work of your hands</i> (Ecclesiastes 5:5). That means to say, when they are young, as they are [then] recognizable that they are the work of your hands, since you feed and sustain them. It is also from this extraneous language that it is shown that a person actively brings this thing to himself from the iniquity of vows. It is as scripture states: <i>do not say before the angel that it was an error; why should God be angered by your voice, etc.</i>"

            "<b>May my portion be among those who complete Hallel every day:</b> In the Gemara, it is explained as [meaning] the verses of praise (<i>pesukei dezimra</i>). But this is difficult. Certainly everyone is careful about saying this every day!?! So it appears to me, with the help of the Heavens, that his saying, \"those who complete Hallel,\" is about the verse, \"Let every soul praise the Lord\" (Psalms 153:6), which is the end of Hallel every day, since we say it after all the verses of praise. And this verse tells a person that for each and every breath, \"Praise the Lord in thought; and this should not move away from your heart.\" (Bereishit Rabbah 14:9). And fortunate is the one who fulfills what this verse, which is the end of the Hallel, states - that he should truly praise God, may He be blessed, in his thought for each and every breath. ",

            "<b>May I receive [my reward] because I never walked four cubits with my head uncovered.</b> It appears to me that the reason for this prohibition, besides the well-known reason, is that, behold, evil spirits are floating in the world's atmosphere. And there are some of them which draw from the evil portion of the eyes of the primordial snake, and they have poison from [that] evil eye that injures a person when they gaze at him. Indeed, since they come from the side of the primordial snake about which it is written, <i>And the snake was cunning</i> [<i>arum</i>, which is also the word for naked], when they accordingly see a naked body without a covering or clothing, they are drawn to it and attach themselves to it more. And then it follows that they implant the poison of the evil eye upon him and injure him. As that is the nature of every creation, to be drawn to that which is similar to it. But since they float in the atmosphere above, the only thing visible to their eyes is the head, and if it is naked, without a covering, they are then drawn by it to attach themselves to it, and that man is subsequently injured by their evil eye. <b>And that is why it is forbidden for a man to walk four cubits with his head uncovered.</b> Because four cubits is an important and defined measure. And if you will ask how is it that unmarried women are permitted to walk bareheaded [even] in the ideal case, behold, females are different. As these spirits that have the poison of the evil eye are from the male side of the primordial snake, which [itself] was male. So they cling to males and not to females. And that is why it is written, <i>Behold [...] Esau [...] is coming and there are four hundred men with him</i> (Genesis 32:7). As four hundred men are the forces of the evil eye [<i>ra ayin</i>], having the numerical equivalent of four hundred; and it called them men, which is male."
