        "2_Genesis, 45_Chapter, 3_Verse, 0_Comment": "In the Guide for the Perplexed (1:27), [Rambam] was amazed at the opinion of Onkelos, since [Onkelos] had exerted all his effort to remove any implication of God’s corporeality from all narratives in the Torah. Accordingly, in the case of any expression found in the Torah implying any mode of motion [referring to God], he ascribed the action to a certain glory that had been created [or a manifestation of the divine presence]. Thus he translated, <i>And God came down</i> (Genesis 11:5) as \"And God manifested Himself\"; <i>I will go down now</i> (Genesis 18:21) as \"I will manifest Myself now.\" And if so, why did he translate [it literally] here, \"I will go down\"? But behold, you will find concerning the explanation in the Guide for the Perplexed for this and that which is similar to it, that Ramban writes at length here and contradicts [Rambam's] explanation and builds a great and awesome explanation [in its place]: As why does Onkelos shun expressions of movement, and also of hearing due to his fear that they might indicate corporeality, but he does not in any place shy away from saying, speaking or calling. For in all of them, he translates, \"and God said\"; \"God spoke\"; \"and God called unto Moses\" — as they likewise signify corporeality? So he should have translated, \"and it was said from before God,\" or \"and the glory of God said,\" or \"and God willed,\" as is appropriate in each case. And he likewise wrote at length about the terms, His divine presence, the word, My word, and glory. But because it is the glory of God to conceal a matter [alluding to Proverbs 25:2], I did not want to copy all the words of the great Ramban. Still, it is commendable for those who beautify the commandments to beautify and look carefully there to what he said, and wisdom will rest upon their understanding hearts. And the end of his words are like this: However what [Onkelos] said here, \"I will go down with you,\" [was because] he wanted to allude through it to that which [the rabbis] said, \"They were exiled to Egypt, the divine presence was with them, as it is said, <i>I will go down with you to Egypt</i>. They were exiled to Elam, the divine presence was with them, as it is said, <i>And I will set My throne in Elam</i> (Jeremiah 49:38), see there.\" However, in the Gemara before us (Megillah 29a:4), it is found [as follows], \"Come and see how beloved the Jewish people are before the Holy One, blessed be He. As every place they were exiled, the divine presence was with them. They were exiled to Egypt, the divine presence was with them, as it is stated, <i>Did I reveal myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt, etc.</i> (I Samuel 2:27). They were exiled to Babylonia, the divine presence was with them, as it is stated, <i>For your sake I have sent to Babylonia</i> (Isaiah 43:14). So too, when, in the future, they will be redeemed, etc.\" However, I have not found the version [cited in] Ramban, even in the Yalkut [Shimoni]. And see Shabbat 89b, \"You said, <i>I will go down to Egypt with you</i>, and he did not ask for mercy on our behalf.\" "
