And that is why the section of the daughters of  Zelophehad is juxtaposed to the count of the Jewish people. For the men hated the land of Israel and said, <i>Let us appoint a head and we will return to Egypt</i> (Numbers 14:4). Whereas the women held the land dear, as they said, <i>Give us a holding</i> (Numbers 27:4)"
