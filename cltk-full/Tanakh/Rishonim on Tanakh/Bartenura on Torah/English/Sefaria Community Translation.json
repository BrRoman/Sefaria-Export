                    "0": "<b>\"And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes\"</b>: He showed honor to the leaders, etc., until \"or perhaps you might think that this section was said only to the leaders.\" This means that although it is written \"to the children of Israel,\" I might interpret \"heads of the tribes of the children of Israel\" as meaning the leaders. We find in many places that the prefix \"ל\" (lamed) at the beginning of a word functions in the place of \"על\" (al, meaning \"upon\" or \"concerning\"). And since the annulment of vows can be performed by a single expert, meaning that it is a mitzvah performed in the best way, I might think that it was said only to the heads of the tribes.",
                    "1": "<b>\"This is the word\"</b>: Moses prophesied with \"thus says,\" etc., until \"Moses added to them by prophesying with 'this is the word.'\" It is difficult because Isaiah also prophesied with \"this is the word,\" as it is written: \"This is the word that the Lord spoke concerning Moab\" and \"This is the word that the Lord spoke concerning Sennacherib, king of Assyria.\" One could say that it means this: \"This is the word that the Lord spoke concerning Moab\" originally through Moses, who prophesied about their punishment, as it is written in the Torah: \"Woe to you, Moab.\" Similarly, concerning Assyria, he prophesied about their punishment, as it is written in the section of Balaam: \"Asshur will be subdued.\" And although it is written in the section of sacrifices offered outside the Temple \"this is the word,\" it seems to Rashi that one should be meticulous here to emphasize the superiority of Moses's prophecy over there because in that context, it is used to teach a law through a verbal analogy, as Rashi explained earlier. However, it is difficult why this was not seen from the verse \"This is the thing that you shall do to them to sanctify them,\" written in the section of Tetzaveh. One could say that since that section is not a prophecy that needs to be communicated to others but a commandment to Moses himself to perform, as the verses demonstrate. It is also difficult what the alternative explanation means by saying \"it is rare.\" One could say that it is because the first interpretation makes it difficult to understand why this commandment was uniquely written in this language more than other commandments in the Torah, and thus it offers an alternative explanation to teach us a specific law in this commandment."

One could say that it means this: \"In her youth\" and not \"a young woman\" as the text usually states in other places. Therefore, it is written afterward, \"A girl of eleven years, her vows are examined,\" etc. This means that the \"youth\" mentioned here regarding vows is not the same as the \"youth\" mentioned in other commandments, which starts at twelve years and one day, as Rambam wrote in Chapter 2 of the Laws of Marriage. Here, it does not simply state \"a young woman\" but rather \"in her youth,\" implying a specific kind of youth according to her intelligence and understanding. Therefore, the criterion is based on examination, as Rashi explained."

It refers to a woman who vowed to become a Nazirite, and her husband heard and annulled it, etc. It is difficult to understand what relevance her husband has here, as the verse speaks about her father. One could say that since this phrase \"the Lord will forgive her\" is written both regarding the father and the husband, Rashi interprets it concerning a betrothed woman whose vows are annulled by both her father and her fiancé. It cannot be said that her father annulled it and she did not know because she lives in his house, if the text is speaking about a young woman. Similarly, if it is speaking about a married woman, it cannot be said that her husband annulled it and she did not know because she lives in his house. Therefore, it seems that the text speaks about a betrothed woman who lives in her father's house and vowed to become a Nazirite. Her husband heard and annulled it, and she did not know because she does not live in his house. She knows the law that her father and fiancé must annul her vows, and she is aware of her father's annulment but unaware of her fiancé's annulment. Thus, she transgresses her vow, etc. Therefore, this phrase is written regarding all annulments, whether by the father or the husband, as I have explained."

One could say that according to the first explanation, it is difficult because although the Moabites were involved in the matter of Balaam's curse due to fear and thus were spared, nevertheless, they should not have been spared for the matter of Peor, where they caused Israel to sin by making their daughters available for promiscuity. For one who causes another to sin, it is worse for him than if he were killed, as Rashi explained in the section of \"Ki Tetzei.\" Therefore, the second explanation is offered: because of the two good doves, etc. This means that the Moabites were also deserving of punishment, but they were spared because of the two good doves, meaning two righteous women: Ruth the Moabitess and Naamah the Ammonitess. Although Naamah was an Ammonite, the reason is attributed to Moab because from Ruth the Moabitess came David, and thus she merited to marry Solomon. However, earlier in the section of Pinchas, in the verse \"Harass the Midianites,\" Rashi did not write the first explanation because the term \"vengeance\" is not used there as it is here, and thus the first explanation does not fit there."

It is difficult because if this is so, there would have been 13,000 (soldiers), yet the text states 12,000. One could say that the 12,000 mentioned refers only to those who were conscripted against their will, as Rashi explained. However, the 1,000 from the tribe of Levi were not conscripted against their will; rather, they went voluntarily. And although they refrained due to Moses' impending death, the tribe of Levi was more zealous in fulfilling the commandment of the Holy One, blessed be He."

Another explanation is that he went to avenge the vengeance of Joseph, etc. Another explanation is that he was the anointed for war. It is difficult to understand why the phrase \"another explanation\" is used twice. One could say that the second explanation seems more fitting than the first because the text brings back the word \"them\" close to \"and Phinehas,\" which implies that he also went to avenge his own vengeance in their death, as it is written, \"take vengeance for the children of Israel.\" Then, another explanation is given a second time because the text later brings back the word \"to the army,\" meaning \"and Phinehas the priest to the army,\" indicating that he was appointed over the army, which means he was the anointed for war.",
                    "1": "<b>\"In his hand, in his possession, etc.\"</b>: It seems to me that this is why it is explained as \"in his possession,\" because although one might have thought that he took the trumpets literally in his hand, it cannot be explained this way since it is written, \"and the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets,\" and thus it is necessary to have at least two priests for them."

One could say that according to the first explanation, it should have said \"notirotam\" with the addition of a \"nun\" at the beginning of the word, like \"notrim\" (watchmen). Therefore, another explanation is given: the dwelling places of their nobles, similar to the translation of \"seranim\" (lords) which is translated as \"tornei\" (nobles) of the Philistines, and it does not lack the \"nun.\""

One could say that Rashi follows his own reasoning from his earlier explanation that all the misconduct of the generation depends on the leaders. Therefore, he explains \"through the counsel of Balaam\" right next to it, meaning, \"And behold, you see that the sin of Peor is attributed to Balaam because he was a great man in his generation,\" as Rashi explained earlier in the verse \"from Pethor,\" where all the kings would send him their letters. Therefore, he rearranges the verse."

If I read \"kill every male,\" I would not know if it means to kill the males with the males or to spare the females with the children, etc. It is difficult to understand how I could err regarding sparing the females and children, since initially they were condemned for not distinguishing and were told to spare only the females. Why was the term \"kill\" necessary to exclude this interpretation?<br>One could say that since Moses did not instruct them to spare the females specifically, but rather said \"every female,\" it implies that he was angry because they did not make the distinction between them, thereby causing the sin through Balaam. Therefore, he required the phrase \"kill\" again to clarify that the distinction should be made: all women who know men as men (meaning, those who know men sexually) should be killed, while the children (females who do not know sexual relations) should be spared. This clarification was necessary to exclude the possibility of sparing those who had not caused the Israelites to sin through Balaam. Hence, the repetition of \"kill\" was needed to clarify the matter, as Rashi explained.<br>&lt;/p&gt;"

This needs further investigation."

It appears that Rashi believed that the land of Midian was not divided among the tribes, and therefore he wrote \"from the land of Sihon and Og they were.\" Similarly, in the Book of Joshua, you will not find that the land of Midian was divided at all. Perhaps this was because it was not considered part of the land of Israel, i.e., from the seven nations.<br><b>\"And Nebo and Baal-meon\"</b>: The names were those of idolatry, etc. It is difficult to know how Rashi knew this. One could say that since it is written elsewhere, \"Kiryat Baal, that is, Kiriath-jearim\" (Joshua 9:10), and it is mentioned as \"Baal\" and \"Nebo\" where idolatry is evident (as the names of the deities), it is clear that Baal and Nebo were idolatrous names. Since it says \"Nebo and Baal-meon\" in the same context, it implies that they alone were named after idols and not others. Later, it states \"and Sibmah,\" which implies that their names were not changed as mentioned earlier, but rather, it retained its original name.&lt;/p&gt;"

It is interpreted to mean that she has no house, meaning it has no lasting foundation, as falsehood and flattery have no standing. There, in Zechariah, the verse speaks of flattery.",

One could say that since it is written, \"And your children will be shepherds in the wilderness for forty years\" (Numbers 14:33), and the term \"shepherds\" implies exile and wandering, as in \"And He revealed Himself to me in the tent of the shepherds\" (Numbers 22:8). This means that He decreed to move and make them wander.<br>Regarding Rashi’s subsequent explanation, he compares it to a king who took his son to be healed, etc. This means that Israel was in a state of illness in Egypt, deeply immersed in idol worship and numerous sins. Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, took them to Mount Sinai and to the desert to heal them from these sins and to teach them the Torah.<br>When they were about to enter the Land of Israel and return to the status of their forefathers—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—when the Divine Presence was revealed to them constantly, the text began to list all the journeys. This means that at each place where they camped, it was as if their heads were raised, so to speak. In this section, the Torah recalls significant events at specific locations, such as the incident at Rephidim where there was no water to drink, and at Mount Hor where Aaron died. These are somewhat like hints or allusions.<br>One could also say that this passage addresses even those who commit sins inadvertently, as it concludes with \"The land is soaked with blood,\" which means that there are many who are misled and deceived. The beginning of the passage speaks of those who sin intentionally, as explained.&lt;/p&gt;"

Therefore, the second explanation is that the High Priest was considered deficient in not praying to prevent this mishap, which is why it refers back to his death and to the days of the second High Priest."
