This applies even to a non-Jew in the marketplace, meaning a non-Jew who does not know him personally but happens to encounter him in the marketplace. How much more so when the non-Jew knows him. It was said about Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai that he never failed to greet anyone with peace, even a non-Jew in the marketplace."
