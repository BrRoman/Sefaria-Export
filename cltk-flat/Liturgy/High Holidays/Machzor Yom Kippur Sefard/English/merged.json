May it be your will, Lord my God and the God of my ancestors, that this hour be a time of favor and mercy. You will rise up and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to favor it, for the appointed time has come.

May our eyes see and our hearts be glad. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in your sight, Lord my rock and my redeemer.",
