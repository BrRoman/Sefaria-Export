                "<b>18) Ibid: Who are accustomed to going out, etc.</b> [Regarding] those women who come from lands in which their custom is not to show [ their hair] to a place in which their custom is to show it, they are permitted to show it if they are not planning to go back. Maharam AlShaker 35; Magen Avraham, minor note 4; SuB 2. However, in the Zohar, Parashat Nasso 125b, it was very strict about a woman's hair, such that none of it should be seen outside, and this is its wording there: Rabbi Chizkiah said, \"Cursed be the man who allows his wife to let the hair of her head be seen. This is one of the rules of modesty in the house. A woman who exposes her hair for self-adornment brings poverty on her household, renders her children of no account in their generation, and causes another thing to abide in her house. If this is so in the house, how much more is it when in the marketplace; and ever so much more so does all this result from another kind of shamelessness. And because of this, it is written, <i>Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine within your house</i> (Psalms 128:3).\" Rabbi Yehudah said, \"Hair of the head of a woman being exposed leads to hair of another kind being exposed and impaired. Hence a woman should not let her hair be seen, even by the beams of her house, much less outside. Come and see that as the rule is most strict in the case of a man’s hair, so is it with a woman’s. Consider how much harm a woman’s hair brings about, what it causes above, and what it causes below. It brings a curse on her husband, it causes poverty, it causes something else to happen to her household, it causes the inferiority of her children. May the Merciful One deliver us from their impudence! A woman thus should cover her hair in the four comers of her house. When she does this, what is written? <i>Your children will be like olive trees</i>. As the olive does not shed its leaves either in autumn or summer, but ever retains its superiority over other trees, so her children will excel over other people of the world; her husband, moreover, will receive blessings from above and from below, will be blessed with riches, with children and children’s children. So this is [the meaning of] that which is written, <i>Behold, surely, thus shall the man be blessed…. [And see your children’s children, peace be upon Israel]</i> (Psalms  128:4[-6]).\" To here are its [words]. And SuB cites its words there. "

                "<b>271) There — since they do not raise their palms (to say the priestly blessing) except on holidays, etc.</b> The Agur wrote that he was asked by RI Mulin why the priests do not raise their palms every day, given that it is a positive commandment. And he answered [that] it is because the custom of the priests is first to immerse [in a ritual bath], as it is written in the Hagahot Maimoniot, such that it is difficult for them to immerse in the winter. Hence the custom arose to do it only on holidays. And it is also by reason of [not wanting to] miss work. And when a priest is not called up, he does not transgress [the negation of this positive commandment]. To here are his [words]. And the Beit Yosef cited him and wrote about him; and these are his words: He stretched himself too far to defend the custom of his place, but it is not enough. For that which he wrote [that] it is because we follow the practice of immersing first — that is a stringency that leads to a leniency! And it makes that which is taught [in a baraita] dependent on that which is not taught [meaning, it is unduly prioritizing something the source of which is less authoritative]. For behold, immersion for raising the palms is not mentioned in the Talmud. So even if they followed the stringency of immersing, why should they, on account of that, nullify three positive commandments every day? And even if he does not transgress unless he is called, it is nevertheless preferable for them to fulfill three positive commandments every day and not negate them, given that they are not obligated to immerse and, as a result, leave off from fulfilling three positive commandments every day. And [more correct] are the residents of the land of Israel and the whole kingdom of Egypt who raise their palms every day and do not immerse [themselves first] to raise their palms. To here are his [words]. However our master Rabbi Moshe [Isserles], may his memory be blessed, wrote in the Darkhei Moseh, note 21, \"The reason is because they are preoccupied with their sustenance and are not filled with joy. Hence they do not raise their palms every day, etc.\" — and as he wrote here in the gloss. But Rama MiPano, may his memory be blessed, wrote in paragraph 95 that that which the world follows the practice that the priests do not go up on the platform [to recite the priestly blessing] on any of the days of the year, whether weekday or Shabbat, besides on holidays is a defective custom, see there. And the Knesset HaGedolah [R. Chaim Benvenisti] cited him in the gloss on the Beit Yosef at the end of the paragraph and in the Shayarei Knesset HaGedolah in the gloss on the Beit Yosef, note 27, Magen Avraham, small note 70. And in the Shayarei Knesset HaGedolah there, he wrote that they do not follow the practice that our master Rabbi Moshe, may his memory be blessed, wrote. And so wrote the Olat Tamid [R. Chaim Vital], note 100: As it is fitting and correct in every place not to follow the practice not to find machinations to negate a positive commandment in the Torah; even though the priest does not transgress unless they call him. For regardless, bounty and blessing come to the world through the priestly blessing. To here are his words. And likewise did he write above, note 262, in the name of the Sha'ar HaKavanot that raising the palms is one of the [items] required for the rectification of prayer and it needs to take place every day during the repetition of the prayer leader. And see further in our words above, note 16."

But the words of the Zohar are not understandable, since it is written: <i>in the fourth [month], etc.</i> (Ezekiel 1:1) — Birkei Yosef 3. However, in [the same author, Chaim Yosef David Azulay's] book, Machzik Berakhah, he wrote to resolve this according to what he found in Hagahot HaRamaz on the words of the Zohar mentioned [above], see there. However, it can also be said that the reason that we read the haftara of the Chariot of Ezekiel is because there are visions of the divine presence written in it, and the Jewish people saw visions of the divine presence at the stand at Mount Sinai on that day [Shavuot]. And, if so, it is from the topic of the day.  "

Since it is written, \"and sending,\" we can say that we need it to be specifically through a messenger, see there. But it appears to me that one cannot be exacting about it only being through a messenger. For behold, we have found the expression, \"sending,\" in several places, and it is not with a messenger. As it is written with Noach (Genesis 8:9), \"and he sent out his hand and took it.\" And with Avraham (Genesis 22:10), \"And Avraham sent out his hand.\" And (Deuteronomy 15:13), \"When you send him free from you.\" And there are many like these. Nevertheless, if it is possible, it should be done with a messenger on account of the honor. But if it is impossible, the commandment should not be negated on account of this. And that is simple."
