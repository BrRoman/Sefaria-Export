        "3_Chapter, 3_Tosefta": "The wafers of an Israelite's grain offering that were missing: [If they were missing] before the the handful was offered up, they are disqualified; once the handful was offered up, they are fit.",
        "3_Chapter, 4_Tosefta": "Thanksgiving loaves and the wafers of a Nazirite that were missing: [If they were missing] before the blood of the offering was sprinkled, they are disqualified; once the blood of the offering was sprinkled, they are fit.",
        "3_Chapter, 5_Tosefta": "The two loaves [of Shavuot] that were missing: [If they were missing] before the blood of the lambs was sprinkled, they are disqualified; once the blood of the lambs was sprinkled, they are fit.",
        "12_Chapter, 3_Tosefta": "...R’ Yochanan ben Turta said: why was Shiloh destroyed? Because there they treated holy offerings disgracefully. Why was the first building of Jerusalem destroyed? Because of the idolatry, sexual immorality and spilling of blood that was in its midst. But we know that in the later one (Second Temple period) they labored in Torah and were careful with tithes, so why were they exiled? Because they loved money and each one hated his fellow. This comes to teach you that hating one’s fellow is difficult in God’s eyes, and the Torah considered it equivalent to idolatry, sexual immorality and the spilling of blood: But the final building which will be built in the future, in our days in our life, what is said about it? “And it shall be at the end of the days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be firmly established at the top of the mountains…And many peoples shall go, and they shall say, \"Come, let us go up to the Lord's mount, to the house of the God of Jacob…” (Isaiah 2:2-3) “For there is a day, the watchers shall call on the mountains of Ephraim; Rise! Let us go up to Zion, to the Lord, our God.” (Jeremiah 31:5)"
