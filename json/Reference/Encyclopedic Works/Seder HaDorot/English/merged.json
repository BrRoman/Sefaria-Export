And as a sign of this, his father, Eber, gave him this name. And there is a Christian who wrote that the angels came down from the heavens to inform the heads of each nation of their particular language. However, the holy tongue is not the portion of any angel but rather the portion of God. And you can find something about this in the Jerusalem Targum on the verse: <i>And the Lord scattered them</i> (Genesis 11:8)."

                    "The first day, the 23rd of Adar, began the seven days of inauguration, in which he would put up the tabernacle each morning, offer the sacrifices upon it and take it apart in the evening. And on the eighth day, which was Rosh Chodesh [the first day of] Nissan, he put it up and did not take it apart. <small>Seder Olam and S. K., p. 70a</small>. On the first of Nissan, the sons of Aharon died. <small>So is it in Vayikra Rabba at the end of Chapter 20; and R. Ibn Ezra on Parshat Shmini. But in Parshat Pekudei, he wrote that it appears that the eighth day was on the eighth of Nissan, as it was set up on the first of Nissan; and so wrote Ab. S. in the name of the Sifrei. So, according to this, the sons of Aharon died on the 8th or Nissan, see there. And in the Tanchuma, Pikudei: The tabernacle was established on the 1st of Nissan; it was finished on Rosh Chodesh Adar, the 1st of Adar.</small> On that day the two sons of Aharon took a strange fire, etc. and they died on that day. <small> \"And Nadav and Avihu did die (<i>vayamot</i>, in the singular)\"; and it does not say, \"And Nadav and Avihu died (<i>vayamutu</i>, in the plural),\" because both of them died like one man (M. B). Nadav and Avihu had not yet turned 20, as it is found in the Zohar, the beginning of Parshat Achrei Mot, p. 70; they had not yet left the household of their father (Megaleh Amukot, Orchot Tzaddikim). Nadav was the aspect of Yosef, and Avihu had the aspect of the force (<i>nefesh</i>) of Yitro. They were reincarnated in Pinchas and Eliyahu (Ab. A, 488). Nadav and Avihu were reincarnated in Shimshon (Ab. A, 811). They were absorbed in Chofni and Pinchas (Ab. A, 831). Shmuel was the spirit (<i>ruach</i>) of Kayin, and Yitro was his soul (<i>neshamah</i>. However Nadav and Avihu were the force and the spirit; and they were both clothed in Shmuel (Ab. A, 871). Achav was also from the root of Nadav and Avihu (see there). Eliyahu took the spirit of Nadav (Ab. A, 962). The souls of Nadav and Avihu were mixed in Elisha ben Shefat (Ag. A; M. G.).</small> Then all of the twelve chieftains began to offer sacrifices, each one on his day <small>(Sefer HaYashar)</small>."

                    "Solomon's teacher was Shimei, and he did not marry the daughter of Pharaoh the whole time he was alive. But when he married her, Gabriel stuck a pole into the sea and a sand embankment arose, and it was upon it that Rome was built (Sanhedrin 82). But according to the [Roman] chronicles, it was already built. Rather the intention is that [as a result of his marriage], Rome grew and they built a wall around it. (S. K. 15) They say that David gave his son, Solomon, over to Nathan the prophet, such that he be his special teacher, and that the days of his life were 94 years. And they say that besides the compositions that Solomon composed, which are written in the 24 [books of the Bible], he also composed books about the nature of trees, grasses, wild animals, domesticated animals and birds, and the oaths against oppressive demons and it is called Solomon's Key. The queen of Sheba, who came to see Solomon's wisdom, was the queen of an island called Moorea. And she asked many riddles to Solomon, and he answered all of them properly, so she gave him presents and saplings that produce balsam, which Solomon planted in his kingdom. Moreover, it says in the Midrash that this queen became pregnant from Solomon and gave birth to a daughter, and she gave birth to Nebuchadnezzar, who destroyed the Temple. And in that kingdom, they are still accustomed to calling the names of their kings, David or Solomon, since they say they come from that seed. (S. H. K. 98, 272, and see G A 319. And she was the reincarnation of Tamar (See B A 226)."

                    "Ezekiel died during the lifetime of Nebuchadnezzar and was buried in Babylonia between the Euphrates and Kevar Rivers. And when Evil-Merodach reigned and released Jeconiah from prison, 35,000 Jews came out with him and built a dome over Ezekiel's grave. And upon the grave, there is a will that is called a <i>shildkrot</i> (turtle). It is an amazing [piece] of work, and the engraved names of Ezekiel and Jeconiah and a troop of men are visible still today. And they made a large synagogue near it, and there are about 60 towers in the location of the synagogue. So the synagogue stands between the towers, and a reading table was built in [its] courtyard. And behind the synagogue is Ezekiel's grave. And all of [the place] together is called the Synagogue of Ezekiel and Jeconiah. The path to Ezekiel's synagogue is [made up] of streams and vineyards that Evil-Merodach gave him to earn a livelihood from. And this place is a Jewish holy site, so people from far away come to pray there. And on Yom Kippur, they take out a parchment Torah scroll handwritten by Ezekiel and read from it. And there are oil lamps lit upon his grave the entire day. There is also a big holy room there filled with many books from the destruction of the First and Second Temples. And when the Ishmaelite leader reigned over these places, he preserved all of these synagogues until this day. And see the book, Beit Yisrael, I have transposed it in [Hebrew]; it is good to transpose it, as it is wondrous. And the study hall over Ezekiel's tomb is a very beautiful building, and everything is golden. However, the western wall is from plaster and the grave is from limestone, its height being three cubits. And the entrance to the study hall is small, but when people come to pray there, the entrance expands."

                    "Ben Koziva, who was called Bar Kokhva, about whom Rabbi Akiva expounded: <i>a star rises from Jacob</i> (Numbers 24:17), rebelled against the Romans and slaughtered a large number of them; and Greeks in Africa, like the sand of the sea which is too numerous to count (alluding to Genesis 32:13), and likewise in Egypt. And the residents of Alexandria also killed over 200,000 Romans [at that time], and the Jews of Cyprus killed all the gentiles until they left none remaining (alluding to Joshua 11:8), etc. So he made himself the messiah, and R. Akiva said about him, \"He is the messianic king.\" And the people of Beitar anointed him and crowned him as king, see M A, Chapter 12, and see Yerushalmi, Taanit, Midrash Eichah in the chapter [entitled] the Lord swallowed up, and in Bereshit Rabbah, Parashat Toledot (94). And Rabbi Eliezer HaModai prayed that Hadrian should not conquer Beitar. But a Cuthite spoke slanderously before Bar Koziva, that he wanted to make peace with Hadrian, and they killed him, and a rumor went out. Oh, the worthless shepherd; let a sword descend upon his arm and upon his right eye (alluding to Zechariah 11:17)! And Beitar was conquered on that very day. In Yosifon, Chapter 21, [it is written that] the Jews in the city of Alexandria were all dwelling at one end of the city, and disputes began between them and the Greeks dwelling there in a different end of the city. Alexandro, the governor there, got up in the name of Nero, the Emperor of Rome, and commanded the Jews that they should retreat and give up their weapons. But they rebelled against his words. He then turned into their enemy (alluding to Isaiah 63:10) and killed over 50,000 Jews with [the assistance] of the Greeks. And they afterward returned to their original strength, until after the destruction [of the Temple] when Emperor Trajan similarly came against them and killed all of them, and destroyed Beitar. And then the horn of Israel was trimmed. So the residents of Alexandria were punished since they transgressed the commandment not to go down to Egypt again. And some say it was because they played ball on Shabbat. And Philo the Jew, who was among the residents of Alexandria at the time of Emperor Gaius [Caligula], testified that there were then 1,000,000 Jewish homeowners there. And that was about 80 years before the destruction. And so Bar Kokhva arose 52 years after the destruction. And since he rebelled against Hadrian, they called him Ben Koziva, an expression of falsehood and lying, as he had [also] made himself into the messiah, as mentioned above. And three generations of [this family] ruled over Israel, Romulus, Ben Rufus, and Ben Koziva. And Emperor Hadrian [first] rose against Romulus on the 9th of Av 52 years after the destruction, and some say 73... and killed many in Israel, including Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues. And he destroyed the city to the point that it was no longer known where its place was. And in Megillat Eichah, [it is written that] there were 500 schools in Beitar, and [that] there were more than 300 youths in the smallest of them. And the decree against Beitar was because they had rejoiced at the destruction of the Temple since the kings of Jerusalem forced the residents of Beitar to be under them, and ruled over them against their will. And see T D, that Emperor Trajan sent his nephew, Hadrian, and he slaughtered so many that it had not even been heard or seen like it in the days of Nebuzaradan or in the days of Titus. And see in the chapter [entitled] HaNizakin (Gittin 57b:9) about the great slaughter done at that time when they said, \"<i>The voice of Jacob</i> (Genesis 27:22) — this is [the cry aroused by] Emperor Vespasian, who killed four million people in the city of Beitar. And some say, 'Forty million.'\" Even though the destruction of Beitar was at least 52 years after the destruction [of Jerusalem by] Titus the son of Vespasian, and there were also four Emperors who reigned after Vespasian before Beitar was destroyed, we nevertheless find that kings and Emperor were called by the name of a previous Emperor. So behold, there are [different] opinions about the story of Ben Koziva and the destruction of Beitar. According to Raavad, he was at the time of Emperor Domitian, the brother of Titus, 52 years after the destruction, and Koziva died during his reign. Then his son, Rufus, reigned in his place, and afterward, his grandson, Romulus, who was also called Koziva after his grandfather. And it was in his days that there was the great slaughter in Beitar, 72 years from the destruction. So the rule of Koziva and his progeny lasted 21 years. And [regarding] that which the sages, may their memory be blessed, [wrote] in Seder Olam 30, and also in [the chapter entitled] Chelek (Sanhedrin 93b), that Ben Koziva reigned two and a half years, it can be said that their intention was about the later Koziva. However, that which they wrote that the slaughter of Beitar was 72 years after the destruction does not seem exact. Hence, it appears that it was fifty years after the destruction, in the year 3880."

                    "In the year 5252 (1492 CE), Ferdinand, the king of Spain (see above 172), and his wife Isabella waged war against the Ishmaelites in Grenada and conquered it. And upon their return, they commanded all of the Jews of his kingdom within a short period to leave their lands, Castile, Navarre, Catalonia, Aragon, Grenada, and Sicily. And the residents of Toledo said that they were not present at the death of the [Christian] messiah. As it is written by a very early governor on a large stone in the city square that the Jews in Toledo did not leave from there at the time of the building of the second temple, such that they were not present at his death, but they were not allowed any excuse. 600,000 [Jews] left from there, and their money was worth more than 30,000 ducats, as testified to by Abarbanel in his book, Mayaanei HaYeshuah. And it all went to the treasury. Under great pressure for their lives, they left in whatever boats they could find to Africa, Asia, and the lands of Greece and [Asia Minor]. And all of the [punishments found in the Biblical] rebukes were fulfilled upon them. And I will recount one of countless things that happened to them: One of them was scattered to one of the islands of the sea and had a very old father who was overwhelmed by hunger, since they had not eaten for three days. So the son was moved by mercy for his father — since they had neither bread nor clothing, as they remained naked and bare [alluding to Ezekiel 16:7], he took his only young son, walked to the nearby city, and sold the child to the baker for bread to revive the old man. But when he returned to his father with the bread, he found him fallen dead. So he tore his clothes and returned to the baker with the bread to take back his son, but [the baker] did not want to return the youth to him. So the Jew cried out in a mighty voice for his son, but there was no one to save him. And another story like this that happened to one of the exiles: There was an old man and an old woman, and [their] daughter was very beautiful; they had no place to sleep and stayed in the field during the night. So in the middle of the night, a robber came and raped the maiden and stole all of their things. But within the hour, the robber returned and killed the maiden, saying that lest she became pregnant from him, he did not want his offspring to remain among the Jews. And there were many thousands and tens of thousands like these [stories] of what happened to the exiles. You will find some of them in the preface of [R. Yehudah] Chayat to his commentary on Marakhet Elokut, in Shevet Yehudah, and in Abarbanel's introduction to the book of Kings. And you should know that the portion that sought to go to Portugal was about 300,000. But the Jews [already living there] made efforts with the king not to allow them to enter there, because this kingdom was too small to absorb such an amount of poor people. And when Don Yosef ben Yichayah, the grandfather of the Gaon, my master, my father, heard, he let out a great shout about it, \"How can we lock the gates of salvation to the poor, etc.\" But they did not listen to his voice. So the exiles had to make a deal with the king that he allow them to come into his kingdom, such that each one had to give two ducats per person. But after a short while, many of them chose to leave from there, and the king investigated if they paid according to the deal, but found that many had not paid, so he took their children between six and ten as payment and sent them to an island elsewhere that he wanted to populate. But it was in vain for him, since most of them died from the snakes, and from famine, etc. And when our elder saw that his fellows did not accept his counsel, and he also saw that the face of the king was ill-disposed towards the Children of Israel, he went to Italy with his children, as he wrote in the chronicles of the Yichayah family. And just as he thought, so it was. For the king of Portugal, Don Manuel, proclaimed with the loud voice of a herald [alluding to Daniel 3:4] that in a short amount of time, all of the Jews would need to convert. And if not, they had to leave. So the Jews chose to go. But when the king saw that they wanted to leave, and he knew that most of the wealth and the sciences were among the Jews and if they would leave, his kingdom would be like a net without any fish, he sent to call all of the [Jewish] homeowners and said to them that his desire was to give them ships and provisions for the journey, to the point that he brought them into his great court with goodly words. Then he began to speak to them with goodly words, that they should convert. But when he saw they did not desire to convert, he took all the youths, brought them to his house of prayer, and threw water upon them [to baptize them] and he gave each one of them a name according to his wish and divided them up to Christian homes to teach them their teaching. And likewise did he do with the old men. But many of them threw themselves into pits, channels, and caves and died from difficult deaths, and killed one another, etc. And out of the Portuguese exile, they were scattered to the four corners of the world. Some of them went to Italy, but the [Jewish] community of Rome promised the pope 1,000 ducats in order that he not let the Spanish Jews into his land. But the pope was angered, saying, \"How cruel can you be, towards your brothers?\" So he decreed that they leave his land and that Spanish Jews come in their place. So they needed to spend much money to negate the decree, etc. And in a short time, there was an expulsion from the lands of Aragon, Navarre, and Provence."
