                "<b>\"And you shall bless\"</b>: According to the plain meaning, this is not a command, but a statement that your well-being and success will be so great that you will naturally recognize the kindness of the Creator and be moved to bless Him. Afterwards, there is a warning to be careful not to forget that it was the Lord who gave this to them. For it is human nature that when great goodness comes to a person, they bless the Lord. However, over time, that goodness becomes natural to them, and they forget their previous condition."

                "When you chance upon a nest ~ On the approach of man, were not for the compassion on her young, the dam would naturally leave the chicks in order to escape. But her maternal love prompts her to scorn prudence and risk her life to save them. Man should therefore not take her so that her righteousness and her love with which she loves her young should not lead her to suffer. This is to teach us to respect the good moral qualities and inculcate in our hearts the idea that one never suffers a loss for doing justice. Had we been permitted to take the mother bird away from her young, man would have concluded that pity was an undesirable and foolish quality, bringing suffering on those exercising it. And now, knowing that taking her is forbidden to us, the essence of the quality of mercy will be inculcated in our hearts very deeply."
