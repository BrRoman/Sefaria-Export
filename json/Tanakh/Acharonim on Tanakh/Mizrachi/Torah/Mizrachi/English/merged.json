It appears to me that Rashi of blessed memory intended with this to inform us that this Baraita holds that the explanation of the word \"with Me\" refers to that which you make to stand with Me, that they are the cherubim, and it is interpreted both before and after it: you shall not make like those with Me, which are the angels, cherubim, and Ophanim, and with Me, which are the cherubim that you make to stand with Me, should not be made of silver, and not four, even of gold.
