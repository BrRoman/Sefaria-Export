And God said, there would be brooks which stretch out [alluding to Numbers 24:6] – these brooks were the Tigris, Euphrates, Pishon, Gichon, Amanah and Parpar Rivers, and those like them – that flow and move from place to place, from country to country, and from city to city. As they fulfill two types of purposes at once in their flowing: The first is that the water gives people, domesticated animals, wild animals, and birds water to drink and quenches the thirst of the creatures. The second is that they water the soil, as a result of which it produces vegetation and its fruits. And you find the same idea is present in the study hall, which is established as a place for the study of Torah and a place for the study of proper behavior [<i>derkh eretz</i>]. And the children study of this and that every day, they go from strength to strength [alluding to Psalms 84:8] during all the hours of the day. It comes out that this study hall is modeled on those [rivers] which give people to drink and water the soil, such that two purposes come out from them, one for man and one for the soil, such that the heavens and the earth kiss. So, too, are these study halls: They give water to drink for the soul, which relates to the heavens; and they water the body with proper behavior, which relates to the soil. "
