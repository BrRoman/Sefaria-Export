According to their opinion, in a case where she does not feel one of these three sensations at the time that blood exudes from her body, or alternatively when she experiences a sensation like a back ache or stomach ache, which typically for her is accompanied by periodic bleeding, this bleeding is evaluated according to the [more lenient] laws of spotting.",
                "3": "Hence any time these drippings are found on a pantyliner or on colored underwear, she is not forbidden even if this phenomenon continues. Liquid on colored underwear does not forbid without a sensation. That said, even though sexual relations are permissible according to the letter of the law when there are [such] spots, nevertheless, it is advisable to refrain from them, lest they find blood after the relations and a stringent question arise about one who sees blood on account of intercourse. Such restraint also makes it possible for you to ascertain if these spots develop into true periodic bleeding."
