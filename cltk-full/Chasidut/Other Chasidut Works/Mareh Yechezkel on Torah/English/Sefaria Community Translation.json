(Tehillim 20:6) The Explanation of that verse is someone who hasn’t got up to this attribute; several days and weeks have passed and during the days of the Sefira, they have not managed to improve anything.  How can they ascent the Mountain of Gd on the holy festival? However when you unite with your creator and you don’t do something for your own sake it is possible to skip ledaleg  that is why it says (Shir Hashirim 2:4) his flag of love was over me  Do not read it as their ‘flag’ diglo rather their ‘skipping’ dilugo; When this person serves with love it is possible to jump to the highest level even though it is not following the usual order…",

            "4": "<b><i>Like a nation that does righteousness, etc.</i></b> The explanation is that which it is stated, <i>Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and those that return to her with righteousness</i> (Isaiah 1:27). As it is on account of these two, namely judgment and righteousness, that the redemption is hastened. But there is a need to understand the reason for the thing. And it appears to me that when we want to fix some corruption, there is a need to see its basis. So behold, the Temple was destroyed on account of jealousy [and] hatred. Hence if we want to hasten the redemption and bring back the [Godly] flow to the Jewish people, there is a need to pursue peace and to be forbearing with one's traits. And these two traits, namely judgment and righteousness, are a charm for peace, as it is written: <i>And the work of righteousness shall be peace</i> (Isaiah 32:18); <i>the judgment of truth and peace</i> (Zechariah 8:16). And hence it stated here that they are complaining about My traits and want to know My ways as if they were supporting judgment and righteousness. So they therefore say, <i>Why, when we fasted, did You not see, etc.</i> (Isaiah 58:3). But He answered to this, <i>Because you fast in strife and contention, etc.</i> (Isaiah 58:4). And that is that which is written, <i>they ask of Me judgments of justice; they desire that God should be near</i> (Isaiah 58:2). For it is just the opposite — they apply the laws upon themselves and mention their sin in searching, as per the below, and I have written ethical teachings and rebukes about this at length. But the Lord does not desire burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as obedience to His voice [alluding to I Samuel 15:22]. So what will words of fasting and the recital of Psalms help when he lays an ambush for [his fellow] inside himself [alluding to Jeremiah 9:7]? And one should truly not likewise blame the rest of the uneducated people, since they follow their leaders who do not speak peacefully among themselves. And it is because of these individuals that they do not have the yoke of Torah and judgment upon them."
