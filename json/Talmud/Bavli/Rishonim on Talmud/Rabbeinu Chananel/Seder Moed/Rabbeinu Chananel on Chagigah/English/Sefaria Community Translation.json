            "Rabbah said, \"All that Ezekiel saw, Isaiah saw like him. Why did Ezekiel wonder as a result of the vision [he had]? Since Ezekiel was similar to a villager who saw the processions of the king and his chariots and armies. So he began to wonder. But Isaiah [can be compared] to a city dweller who sees these processions every day. Therefore he did not wonder about them.\" <i>I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted</i> (Exodus 15:1). <i>Sing to the One who is exalted over the exalted</i> meaning the King over the kings. As there are four kings in the world. Man among [all living beings],  the lion among wild animals, the ox among domesticated animals, and the eagle among the birds. But the Holy One, Blessed be He, may His name and His glory be blessed, is above all of them."
