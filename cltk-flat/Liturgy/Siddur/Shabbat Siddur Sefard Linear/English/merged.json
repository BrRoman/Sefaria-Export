The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to God. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt-offering which is consumed in its entirety on God’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve God but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים , peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to God, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i>",
