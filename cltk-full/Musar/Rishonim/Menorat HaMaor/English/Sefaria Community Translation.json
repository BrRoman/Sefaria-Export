And even though one is obligated by the honor of one’s father, the honor of his teacher is greater. For his father brought him to this world, whereas his teacher allows him to inherit life in the world to come. Hence if his father and this teacher were captured and he does not have the ransom for both of them, he should ransom his teacher. However if his father is a Torah scholar, he should redeem his father before his teacher. As the honor of the Torah and the honor of his father [when in combination] are greater than the honor of his teacher. This is as we learned in Bava Metzia (33a:9) in the chapter [entitled] Elu Metziot, \"If his father and his teacher were in captivity, he first redeems his teacher and thereafter redeems his father. And if his father is a Torah scholar, he first redeems his father and afterwards redeems his teacher.”",

Abraham, from where [do we know it]? As it is written (Genesis 15:2), ‘And [he] said, “My Lord God, what will You give me?’” He would not have said, ‘What will You give me,’ unless He had said to him, ‘Ask.’ Solomon, from where [do we know it]? As it is written (I Kings 3:5), ‘In Givon, the Lord appeared to Solomon [... and …] said, “Ask that which I shall give you.”’ Achaz, from where [do we know it]? As it is written (Isaiah 7:10-11), ‘And the Lord spoke further to Achaz, “Request a sign for yourself from the Lord, your God.”’ The messianic king, from where [do we know it]? As it is written (Psalms 2:8), ‘Request of Me, and I will render nations your inheritance, your estate will be the limits of the earth.’” Rabbi Levi said, “The Holy One, blessed be He, showed our father Abraham, peace be upon him, the stars, the constellations and all the corners of the firmament, as it is stated (Genesis 15:5), ‘And He took him outside (<i>chutzah</i>).’ And did He take him outside of the universe? Rather it is that He showed him the chambers of the skies that are called <i>chutzot</i>, as it is stated (Proverbs 8:26), ‘Before He made earth and <i>chutzot</i>.’” Rabbi Yehudah bar Ilai said, “Five things did the Holy One, blessed be He, show to our father Abraham, peace be upon him, and these are them: 1) He showed him the splitting of the Red Sea, as it is stated (Genesis 15:17), ‘which passed between these pieces (<i>gezarim</i>).’ And likewise does it state (Psalms 136:13), ‘To slice the Red Sea into pieces (<i>gezarim</i>).’ 2) He showed him the giving of the Torah, as it is stated, ‘and behold, a smoking furnace and a flaming torch.’ And likewise is it with the giving of the Torah (Exodus 20:14), ‘And the entire people saw the torches and the sound of the shofar. 3) He showed him the Temple built and [4)] the order of the sacrifices, as it is stated, (Genesis 15:9), ‘He said to him, ‘Take for Me a calf of three.’ [5)] And He showed him the four empires (destined to subjugate Israel), as it is stated, (Genesis 15:12) ‘and behold, a dread of deep darkness fell upon him.’ Those were the four empires.” Rabbi Channan said, “He showed him the revival of the dead, as it is stated (Genesis 15:10), ‘Birds of prey came down upon the carcasses.’ He took the limbs and placed them side by side. And once the bird descended upon them, they came to life, as it is stated, ‘but Abram repelled (<i>vayashev</i>) them.’ And <i>vayashev</i> is always that they are scattered by the wind (which is only possible here if they returned to life), as it is stated (Isaiah 40:7), ‘when the breath [of the Lord] blows (<i>nashvah</i>) upon it.’”"

And he should sell that which is light, which is wealth, and purchase that which is honorable, which is the study of Torah, as it is written, <i>It is more precious than rubies, etc.</i> (Proverbs 3:5). And fortunate is one who does so and fortunate is his lot! For he sells temporary life, which is wealth, and he purchases eternal life and existence forever and ever, which are words of Torah. And we have this text in the Pesikta [see Vayikra Rabbah 30:1]: Rabbi Yochanan was ascending from Tiberias to Tzippori, and Rabbi Chiya bar Abba was supporting him. They arrived at a certain field. [Rabbi Yochanan] said, \"This field was mine, and I sold it in order to study Torah.\" They arrived at a certain vineyard. He said, \"This vineyard was mine, and I sold it in order to study Torah.\" They arrived at a certain olive grove. He said, \"This olive grove was mine, and I sold it in order to study Torah.\" Rabbi Chiya bar Abba wept. Rabbi Yochanan said to him, \"Why are you weeping?\" He said to him, \"I am crying because you did not leave anything for your old age.\" He said to him, \"Chiya, my son, is it insignificant in your eyes what I did, that I sold an item that was given in six days and acquired an item that was given in forty days and forty nights?\" Behold, we learned that it, the Torah, is more precious to a person than any desirable vessel in the world. And we have this text in Bereishit Rabba (35:3): <i>It is more precious than rubies, all objects cannot equal it</i>, but [another] verse says, <i>all of your objects cannot equal it</i> (Proverbs 3:15). \"[All] objects\" – these are commandments and good deeds. \"Your objects\" – these are precious stones and pearls. These and those cannot equal it, [all] objects and your objects cannot equal it, as it is written, <i>Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom</i>(Jeremiah 9:22), meaning if his wisdom is foreign wisdom; <i>let not the strong man glory in his strength</i>, meaning if it is not that he is conquering his [evil] impulse. As it has been learned [Avot 4:1], \"Who is rich? One who is satisfied with his lot. [Who is strong? One who conquers his impulse.] <i>Rather, let the one who glories, glory in this: perceiving and knowing Me</i> (Jeremiah 9:23). And there is no knowing of the Holy One, blessed be He, except for the knowing of Torah, as it is stated, <i>You have been shown that you might know that the Lord, He is God, there is none else</i> (Deuteronomy 4:35). And it is written after it, <i>From the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you, etc.</i> (Deuteronomy 4:36). And I have heard if from the rabbi, Rabbi Yehudah, let the memory of the righteous be for a blessing, the son of Rosh: <i>Thus said the Lord: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom; let not the strong man glory in his strength; let not the rich man glory in his riches. Rather, let the one who glories glory in this: perceiving and knowing Me, for I the Lord act with kindness, justice, and righteousness [<i>tzedekha</i>] in the world, for in these I delight, declares the Lord.</i> It states in this verse, \"wise, strong, and rich,\" and \"kindness, justice, and righteousness\" corresponding to them. This is to tell you, if he is wise, let him not glory in his wisdom unless he does kindness with it and teaches Torah to the masses. And if he is strong, let him not glory in his strength unless he does justice, since he has the capability. And let not the rich glory in his riches unless he does righteousness [gives <i>tzedekha</i>] to the poor."

                "1": "One recites the blessing, \"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, who sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to affix the mezuzah.\" And one must place it on the right, as it is stated: <i>And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house (beitecha) and in your gates</i> — the way you enter (<i>biatecha</i>). And when a person lifts his foot [to begin walking], he lifts his right foot first (Yoma 11b:9). And all entrances are obligated in [having] a mezuzah, except for entrances that are not the way of respect [such as bathrooms]. And it is the obligation of the one living in the house to place a mezuzah. As Rav Mesharshiyah said, \"Affixing a mezuzah is the obligation of the resident.\" And that is even though the house is not his, but only rented by him. And when he leaves, he may not take it in his hand and leave; rather, he must leave it there. And this is the case if a Jew will [replace him] in the house. But if a gentile [will replace him], he may take it and leave. As we follow the textual version in Bava Metzia (102a:2) in the chapter [entitled] HaShoel: Come and hear — One who rents out a house to his fellow, it is incumbent upon the renter to prepare a mezuzah for it. And when he leaves, he may not take it in his hand and leave. But if it is [the house of] a gentile, he may take it in his hand and leave. And there was an incident in which a renter took his mezuzah in his hand and left; and he buried his wife and two sons. And we follow the textual version in the chapter [entitled] BeMeh Madlikin (Shabbat 32b): For the sin of mezuzah do a person's sons and daughters die when they are young, as it is stated: <i>the blood of the souls of the innocent poor</i> (Jeremiah 2:34), and next to it is: <i>you did not find them breaking in</i>. The understanding is that because they made entrances like a thief’s breach, without a mezuzah, their innocent poor, who are one's sons and daughters, died. And we place them at the entrance on the outside. For the attribute of the Holy One, blessed be He, is not like the attribute of a king of flesh and blood. The attribute of flesh and blood is that a king lays down inside his room, and his servants protect him from the outside, whereas the Jewish people, who are the servants of the Holy One, blessed be He — as it is stated: <i>For it is to Me that the children of Israel are servants</i> (Leviticus 25:55) — lay down inside, and the Holy One, blessed be He protects them from the outside. As it is stated: <i>The Lord is your keeper, the Lord is your shade upon your right hand. The Lord will guard your going and coming now and forever</i> (Psalms 121:5, 8).",
                "2": "And these are the places that are obligated in [having] a mezuzah according to the explanation of Rabbi Yaakov, may his memory be blessed, in his book, [Tur] Yoreh Deah [286:1]: Whether they are gates of houses, gates of courtyards, city or townlets, a cowshed, chicken coops, a shed for straw, a wine cellar, and a storeroom for oil, a women's room, a shared structure, a straw storehouse, a wood storehouse, and a cow barn — in a standard case, they are obligated. However, if women bathe in them, they are exempt. Standard village synagogues are obligated since people generally dwell in them. But with those of cities, it is [only] obligated if there are residential quarters in it; and, if not, it is exempt. But anywhere there is residential home, it is obligated, even if it is in a place of refuse. [Yet] it is good to cover it, so that it not be visible. A toilet, a bathhouse, a tanner's shop, and a bath for immersion are exempt. And Rabbi Meir of Rothenberg wrote that when he would take an afternoon nap in his study hall, a bad spirit would terrify him until he affixed a mezuzah. And the Rosh, may his memory be blessed, wrote that a house that does not have four handbreadths square is exempt from [having] a mezuzah:"

When he sees about himself that, among his fellows, he is like a lion among flocks of sheep, he will trust in the power of his strength: If they rise up against him and he defeats them, he will not recognize the hand of God that saved him from their hand, so he will not hail and praise [God]. Rather, he will say, \"I did it with the strength of my hand.\" So his heart will turn from God and he will deny a major principle, as happened with Goliath the Philistine, who blasphemed the God of the Jewish war encampments.",
            "7": "What is its antidote? He should put into his heart and contemplate how many strong men failed with their strength; due to the circumstances, they fell into the hands of weaker ones. [Likewise should one contmplate] that there is no strong man who can escape accidents, like hitting his foot on a rock, falling from the roof, drowning in a river, getting sick or other accidents that are similar to this, that have no connection to strength. So the only salvation and rescue for someone from them is God, may He be blessed, who has the salvation. He should attach a poem of accidents to his heart, and see that he has no protections and no shelter other than the supernal Shelter; and that he has no protection if he does not seek protection from Him. For 'who is the one and which one is it' who is as strong as Goliath? But because he relied upon his strength and trusted in his weapons and the copper helmet on his head and his spear, that was like a weaver's shaft, he disparaged David; that is why he fell into his hand. Whereas David who trusted in God, who was his strength, stole the spear from his hand and severed his head. And likewise did he say to him when he approached him (I Samuel 17:45), \"You come to me with the sword, etc.\" When a person looks at and contemplates these things and their particulars, he will place his mind towards Him and plant his spirit in the hand of the 'God of the spirits of all flesh,' 'who gives strength to men to establish power.' And then the haughtiness of his heart will bow down and he will lower his uppity eyes. But 'kindness will surround the one who trusts in God.'"
