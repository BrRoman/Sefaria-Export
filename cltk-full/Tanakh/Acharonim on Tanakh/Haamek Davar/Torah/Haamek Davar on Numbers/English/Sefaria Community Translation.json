(Similarly, the language of the Mishnah - Shevi’it, Chapter 8, Mishnah 11 - “And if he is regarded,” meaning he is respected and esteemed.) As it says in Sanhedrin 104a: \"I said that Israel would dwell securely alone, in the isolation of Yaakov's eye, but now they sit alone in distress.\" This means that My [God’s] desire was for Israel to remain separate, to not mingle with other nations, and thus they would be secure. Now, because they desired to assimilate with other nations, they have become isolated, and no nation values them enough to include them. And in Pesachim 118b, [it is written,] “The mingling of nations—they long for closeness.” Who caused Israel to be scattered among the nations? It was the closeness that they longed for with them. And [it is brought in] Shemot Rabbah 1, that Israel in exile in Egypt, they refrained from circumcision, saying, “Let us be like the Egyptians.” So, what did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He turned the hearts of the Egyptians to hate His people. They thought that since they were in exile, it was proper not to remain separate from them. But the opposite happened: the Egyptians separated themselves from Israel. And a reason for this was because the people of G-d have a distinct form, elevated above other peoples. And I have already explained above (21:20). Someone with a higher form who destroys it becomes worse than those beneath him and is scorned by them. If this is so, this is a sign that Israel’s origins are from the “tops of the rocks”. This is why the form of a person is not easily lost, as it is natural for everyone to preserve their essential form, for which they were created. And therefore, someone who goes, in every event, against their intended form is not considered a human at all. And behold, he is like an ape in the form of a human."

He also said that its usage [is like its usage in], \"those with revealed shet\" (Isaiah 11:3), which is a reference to the daughters of Lot (the mothers of Ammon and Moab). But that is distant [from the correct understanding] in my eyes; as shet is the posterior, which is like a foundation, as in (Psalms 11:3), \"When the shatot are destroyed.\" And many understood, \"all the children of shet\" as the same usage as \"When the shatot.\" And the explanation is that when he destroys the countries (which are like foundations).

And the phrase \"however, to the family, etc.\" is only advice, as mentioned in the tractate Yesh Nochalin. It has been clarified earlier that due to their significance, the divine authority allowed for the passing of inheritance. They are like women who have already given birth from another tribe, and they inherit and pass on the inheritance, as explained shortly after. And because of this minor distinction, it does not harm the establishment of the sanctity of the land. However, it is advised that they should not appear more important than any other daughters of their tribe. Therefore, they should conduct themselves like all of them, as it is prohibited to pass on inheritance in that generation. From this, we learn the importance of advice in many matters, and may the advice of God arise for every individual."
