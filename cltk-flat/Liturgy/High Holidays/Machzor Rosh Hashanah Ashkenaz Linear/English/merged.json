He further writes that since זְרִיזִין מַקְדִימִין לְמִצְוֹת, the diligent come early to perform their religious duties. It is commendable to invalidate one’s vows before Rosh Hashana with the declaration contained in the “הַתָּרַת נְדָרִים,” the Annulment of Vows.",

But for that which one vows or swears to his fellow, or if someone places him under oath, regardless of that person’s nationality or religion, no annulment, invalidation or absolvement is ever possible.",

According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ ‘and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusiouns of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i>",

At the beginning of the evening meal it is customary to dip a portion of the challah in honey and after eating a piece, the weight of an olive, say: “יְהִי רָצוֹן מִלְפָנֶיךָ שֶׁתְּחַדֵשׁ עָלֵינוּ שָׁנָה טוֹבָה וּמְתוּקָה—May it be Your will to renew for us a good and sweet year.” Then, take a piece of sweet apple and dip it in honey. First make the blessing, “בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' אֱלֹהֵֽינוּ מֶֽלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָעֵץ—Blessed are You, Adonoy, our God, King of the universe, Who creates the fruit of the tree.” After tasting it, repeat the above prayer, “יְהִי רָצוֹן—May it be Your will to renew for us a good and sweet year.” It is also a custom to eat a piece of the head of some animal, (preferably a sheep) and say: “יְהִי רָצוֹן שֶׁנִהְיֶה לְראשׁ—May it be Your will that we be at the head.” We also eat certain vegetables, the names of which convey the connotations of good fortune, such as carrots which in Yiddish are called mehren (increase), and we say: “יְהִי רָצוֹן שֶׁיִרְבּוּ זְכוּיוֹתֵינוּ—May it be Your will that our merits increase.”",

According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i>",

According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word וּבְכֵן recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.</i></b>",

He maintains that Yishmael’s mockery consisted of his claiming the premier right of inheritance over Yitzchak.</i> She said to Avraham, “Drive out this slave woman and her son; for the son of this slave woman will not share the inheritance with my son Yitzchak.

They said, “We are brothers, all we ask is some water to quench our thirst. The Yishmaelites first gave them generous helpings of salt fish, saying that it was not good to drink on an empty stomach. Since they were nearly starving, they ate the fish, which made them all the more thirsty. When they asked for water, the Yishmaelites gave them skins filled with air. When they took them to their lips, the pressure exploded their stomachs, killing many of them.<br>The angels said, “The descendants of Yishmael are destined to do such a wicked thing to Your children, killing them with thirst. How can You now save Yishmael, since he himself is also wicked? “I know,” replied the Almighty, “but I judge a person only according to what he is now, and at this point in time, Yishmael doesn’t deserve to die of thirst. See Rashi, Targum Yonassan.</i> “Arise, lift up the lad, and strengthen your hand over him, for I will make him a great nation.” And God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the skin with water and gave the lad to drink. And God was with the lad and he grew up; and he settled in the desert and he became an expert archer. He settled in the desert of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Mitzrayim.",

We are obliged to coronate God as King on this day in the manner written by Dovid, “בַּחֲצֹצְרוֹת וְקוֹל שׁוֹפָר הָרִיעוּ לִפְנֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ ה', With trumpets and the sound of shofar, call out in the presence of the King, Almighty” (Psalms 98:6).",
        "8_Sounding of the Shofar, 2_Paragraph": "2) Rosh Hashana is the beginning of the Ten Days of Repentance and the shofar calls the people to amend their lives before the final judgment of Yom Kippur. It was customary for rulers to issue a final warning to their subjects before punishing them for violating their decrees. Similarly, the shofar represents God’s last warning to His people to repent.",
        "8_Sounding of the Shofar, 3_Paragraph": "3) The sounding of the shofar recalls the revelation of the Torah on Mount Sinai. The Torah was given to us amid blasts of the shofar, as it is written, “וְקוֹל שׁוֹפָר חָזָק מְאֹד,” the sound of shofar was most powerful” (Shemos 19:16), and the people accepted it saying “We will do and we will listen.”",
        "8_Sounding of the Shofar, 4_Paragraph": "4) The shofar brings to mind the warnings and exhortations of the prophets which are likened to the blasts of the shofar, as it is said, וְשָׁמַע הַשֹׁמֵעַ אֶת קוֹל הַשׁוֹפָר וְלֹא נִזְהָר וַתָּבוֹא חֶרֶב וַתִּקָּחֵהוּ דָמוֹ בְּרֹאשׁוֹ יִהְיֶה ... וְהוּא נִזְהָר נַפְשׁוֹ מִלֵט. He who hears the sound of the shofar and does not take warning, the sword come ands takes him away, his blood will be upon his own head ... but he who heeds warning will save his soul. (Yechezkel 33:4,5).",
        "8_Sounding of the Shofar, 5_Paragraph": "5) The shofar reminds us of the destruction of the Holy Temple which was destroyed amid the sounding of enemy trumpets, as it is said: כִּי קוֹל שׁוֹפָר שָׁמַעַתְּ נַפְשִׁי תְּרוּעַת מִלְחָמָה—“For you have heard the sound of the shofar, O my soul, the shouts of battle (Yirmiyahu 4:19); and when we hear the shofar on Rosh Hashana, we pray to God to restore the Temple to its former glory.",
        "8_Sounding of the Shofar, 6_Paragraph": "6) The shofar recalls the willingness of Yitzchak to be sacrificed on the altar in obedience to God’s command to Avraham.

        "8_Sounding of the Shofar, 10_Paragraph": "10) The shofar reminds us of the future resurrection of the dead and it reaffirms our faith that God will revive the dead which will be heralded with the sounding of the shofar.",
        "8_Sounding of the Shofar, 11_Paragraph": "This Psalm (47) is recited seven times prior to the sounding of the Shofar. The Name, אלהים, which refers to God’s manifestation, as One Who rules with strict justice, appears in this psalm seven times. Thus we mention the Name אלהים forty-nine times as a prelude to the sounding of the Shofar. Our sages have said that there are forty-nine levels of spiritual impurity before one reaches the lowest depth, from which no salvation is possible. On the other hand, there are forty-nine ascending levels of intellectual sanctity which man can attain. In reciting this psalm we pray for the blast of the Shofar to arouse God’s mercy to overcome His manifestation of strict justice. We also pray for the sound of the shofar to inspire us to climb from the forty-ninth level of spiritual impurity, to rise to the forty-ninth level of sanctity.",

        "9_Musaf, 1_First Day of Rosh Hashana, 0_Amidah, 229_Paragraph": "The major portion of the Musaf service, is based on the three concepts: מַלְכֻיּוֹת, namely, that God reigns over the world and we accept His rule; זִכְרוֹנוֹת, that He remembers as He reviews our past; and שׁוֹפָרוֹת, that we are called upon to follow Him into a new future of Torah obedience and fulfillment. These thoughts are impressed upon us in the Musaf service by means of detailed references from the Bible. For each of these three concepts we are given ten Biblical quotations, three from the Torah, three from Sacred Writings, (כְּתוּבִים), and three from the Prophets, (נְבִיאִים). The final quotation is again taken from the Torah; for the Torah is the exclusive, basic source of all Jewish truth, and neither the Writings or the Prophets contain any thought that is not contained in some form in the Torah. Thus these series of quotations both begin and end with quotations from the Torah itself. In keeping with the Talmudic principle, מַעֲלִין בַּקוֹדֶשׁ וְלֹא מוֹרִידִין “that one must always proceed upward and forward, and never backward and downward with respect to things holy,” the quotations from the Writings precede those from the Prophets; for while the Writings are only the product of sacred inspiration, רוּחַ הַקוֹדֶשׁ, the words of the Prophets are the actual, direct, Divine revelation. Thus in this sequence, that which is written in the Writings is confirmed by the Prophets and sealed by the Torah.",

In the section dealing with laws of Rosh Hashana (Section 276), he writes, “I found a letter from Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn, in which he wrote that Rabbi Amnon of Mayence authored the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף as a result of a tragic incident in his life.” This is the story as recorded in the letter:",
        "9_Musaf, 1_First Day of Rosh Hashana, 1_Reader's Repetition, 149_Paragraph": "Rabbi Amnon of Mayence, a great scholar, a person of wealth, a handsome man of noble ancestry was under great pressure from the lords and Archbishop of the city to change his faith and adopt their religion. He repeatedly ignored them but on one occasion, in order to put them off, he asked for three days to consider their request. Afterwards he was heartbroken because he had given the impression that he might actually consider renouncing his belief in the One Living God. He refused food or drink; weeping bitterly over his lapse, he refused to accept the sympathy and consolation of friends and relatives.",
        "9_Musaf, 1_First Day of Rosh Hashana, 1_Reader's Repetition, 150_Paragraph": "At the end of the three days he was summoned by the Archbishop, but he ignored the summons. A distinguished delegation was sent to ask him to appear at the court but he refused them. Finally, he was brought before the court by force, and the Archbishop demanded, “Why did you not come and answer me as you promised?” Rabbi Amnon answered, “As a punishment, you should have my tongue cut out, because my tougue deceived you.” Rabbi Amnon thought to sanctify God’s Name in this manner, since his tongue had uttered such a promise. The Archbishop replied, “No, I will not cut out your tongue for it spoke well, instead, I will cut off your feet for they did not bring you to me.” The tyrant ordered that his hands and feet be cut off in piecemeal fashion; asking him at each interval if he was willing to renounce his faith. He was finally released and sent home with his severed and mutilated limbs aside him in bed.",
        "9_Musaf, 1_First Day of Rosh Hashana, 1_Reader's Repetition, 151_Paragraph": "The holiday of Rosh Hashana was at hand, and the Rabbi, dying from the effects of his wounds, was at his own request carried into the synagogue, bringing his severed limbs with him. When the Chazzan was about to recite the Kedushah, Rabbi Amnon asked him to stop, saying, “Pause that I may sanctify His Most Holy Name,” and he said in a loud voice: וּבְכֵן וּלְךָ תַעֲלֶה קְדֻשָּׁה, and thus may this sanctification ascend to You, inferring that with his terrible suffering, he had sanctified God’s Name. He then began reciting the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף, and with the words אֱמֶת כִּי אַתָּה הוּא דַיָּן וּמוֹכִֽיח, true that You are Judge and Admonisher, he indicated his acceptance of God’s Divine judgment, and with the words וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם, and You recorded the decree of their judgments, he manifested his belief that his fate had been decreed on Rosh Hashana. No sooner had he finished the prayer when he expired. Three days later, he appeared to Rabbi Kolonymus ben Meshullam in a dream and taught him this prayer, asking him to introduce it to all congregations as a testimonial and as a memorial for him. This prayer has formed a portion of our Service ever since.",

The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt- offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים, peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i>",

        "9_Musaf, 2_Second Day of Rosh Hashana, 0_Amidah, 199_Paragraph": "The major portion of the Musaf service, is based on the three concepts: מַלְכֻיּוֹת, namely, that God reigns over the world and we accept His rule; זִכְרוֹנוֹת, that He remembers as He reviews our past; and שׁוֹפָרוֹת, that we are called upon to follow Him into a new future of Torah obedience and fulfillment. These thoughts are impressed upon us in the Musaf service by means of detailed references from the Bible. For each of these three concepts we are given ten Biblical quotations, three from the Torah, three from Sacred Writings, (כְּתוּבִים), and three from the Prophets, (נְבִיאִים). The final quotation is again taken from the Torah; for the Torah is the exclusive, basic source of all Jewish truth, and neither the Writings or the Prophets contain any thought that is not contained in some form in the Torah. Thus these series of quotations both begin and end with quotations from the Torah itself. In keeping with the Talmudic principle, מַעֲלִין בַּקוֹדֶשׁ וְלֹא מוֹרִידִין “that one must always proceed upward and forward, and never backward and downward with respect to things holy,” the quotations from the Writings precede those from the Prophets; for while the Writings are only the product of sacred inspiration, רוּחַ הַקוֹדֶשׁ, the words of the Prophets are the actual, direct, Divine revelation.

In the section dealing with laws of Rosh Hashana (Section 276), he writes, “I found a letter from Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn, in which he wrote that Rabbi Amnon of Mayence authored the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף as a result of a tragic incident in his life.” This is the story as recorded in the letter:",
        "9_Musaf, 2_Second Day of Rosh Hashana, 1_Reader's Repetition, 92_Paragraph": "Rabbi Amnon of Mayence, a great scholar, a person of wealth, a handsome man of noble ancestry was under great pressure from the lords and Archbishop of the city to change his faith and adopt their religion. He repeatedly ignored them but on one occasion, in order to put them off, he asked for three days to consider their request. Afterwards he was heartbroken because he had given the impression that he might actually consider renouncing his belief in the One Living God. He refused food or drink; weeping bitterly over his lapse, he refused to accept the sympathy and consolation of friends and relatives.",
        "9_Musaf, 2_Second Day of Rosh Hashana, 1_Reader's Repetition, 93_Paragraph": "At the end of the three days he was summoned by the Archbishop, but he ignored the summons. A distinguished delegation was sent to ask him to appear at the court but he refused them. Finally, he was brought before the court by force, and the Archbishop demanded, “Why did you not come and answer me as you promised?” Rabbi Amnon answered, “As a punishment, you should have my tongue cut out, because my tougue deceived you.” Rabbi Amnon thought to sanctify God’s Name in this manner, since his tongue had uttered such a promise. The Archbishop replied, “No, I will not cut out your tongue for it spoke well, instead, I will cut off your feet for they did not bring you to me.” The tyrant ordered that his hands and feet be cut off in piecemeal fashion; asking him at each interval if he was willing to renounce his faith. He was finally released and sent home with his severed and mutilated limbs aside him in bed.",
        "9_Musaf, 2_Second Day of Rosh Hashana, 1_Reader's Repetition, 94_Paragraph": "The holiday of Rosh Hashana was at hand, and the Rabbi, dying from the effects of his wounds, was at his own request carried into the synagogue, bringing his severed limbs with him. When the Chazzan was about to recite the Kedushah, Rabbi Amnon asked him to stop, saying, “Pause that I may sanctify His Most Holy Name,” and he said in a loud voice: וּבְכֵן וּלְךָ תַעֲלֶה קְדֻשָּׁה, and thus may this sanctification ascend to You, inferring that with his terrible suffering, he had sanctified God’s Name. He then began reciting the וּנְתַנֶּה תֹּקֶף, and with the words אֱמֶת כִּי אַתָּה הוּא דַיָּן וּמוֹכִֽיח, true that You are Judge and Admonisher, he indicated his acceptance of God’s Divine judgment, and with the words וְתִכְתֹּב אֶת גְּזַר דִּינָם, and You recorded the decree of their judgments, he manifested his belief that his fate had been decreed on Rosh Hashana. No sooner had he finished the prayer when he expired. Three days later, he appeared to Rabbi Kolonymus ben Meshullam in a dream and taught him this prayer, asking him to introduce it to all congregations as a testimonial and as a memorial for him. This prayer has formed a portion of our Service ever since.",

The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt- offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a שְׁלָמִים, peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.</i>",

The opening verses are taken from Micah 7:18-20 and they correspond to the thirteen Divine Attributes mentioned in Shemos 34:6,7. The closing verses are from Psalms 118:5-9 which correspond to the nine attributes mentioned in Bamidbar 14:18.",
        "11_Tashlich, 1_Paragraph": "According to Maharam Yaffe the custom of the Tashlich ritual is based on the Midrash. “As Avraham was about to sacrifice Yitzchak, the Satan disguised himself as a raging river. Upon approaching the river, Avraham went in wading up to his waist. Thinking he would be able to ford the river, he summoned Yitzchak and they had taken but a few steps when the water surged up to their necks. Avraham cried out, “Deliver us Adonoy, for the water is drowning us,” and they were saved. Others say that water is the symbol of kindness, and fish symbolize an ever-open eye. Thus we ask God to bestow His benevolent kindness on us and protect us with His watchful eye.",
