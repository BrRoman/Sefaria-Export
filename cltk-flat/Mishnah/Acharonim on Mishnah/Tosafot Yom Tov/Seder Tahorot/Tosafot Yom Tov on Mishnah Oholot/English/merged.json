        "1_, 6_Chapter, 5_Mishnah, 2_Comment": "For one may not set aside one person's life for another's. You might ask about the story of Sheva' ben Bichri [who was handed over by the people of Avel Bet Ma'achah to Yo'av's besieging forces, where it is said (2 Shemu'el 20)] \"his head shall be thrown to you\", where they set aside one life for another! [The answer:] There, it is [different] because even if they had not handed him over, he would have been killed in the city as soon as Yo'av got hold of him, and they would have been killed with him. But if he would have been saved - even though they would have been killed - they would not have been permitted to hand him over to save themselves. Alternatively, [it is different] because he was a high traitor, and thus it is explained in the Tosefta of Terumah (7:23) and by Rashi on Sanhedrin (72b). And the Rash [MiShantz] at the end of the eighth chapter of Terumah wrote that from the Yerushalmi it is evident that if they specified [an extraditee] one may hand [them] over, even if they are not guilty of death. And that is according to [the letter of] the law, but the measure of piety is not to hand [them] over."
