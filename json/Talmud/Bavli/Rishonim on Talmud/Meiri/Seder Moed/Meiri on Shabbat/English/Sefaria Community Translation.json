                "[Regarding] these things and those that are similar to them — in the same way that a person must be careful not to do them, so too must he protest against anyone [doing them], who it is possible for him to protest against. And anyone for whom it is possible to protest and who does not protest, behold it is as if he did [the sin himself]. And that is [the understanding of] that which they said, \"Anyone for whom it is possible to protest against the members of his household and did not protest, he is apprehended for the members of his household; against the people of his town, and did not protest, he is apprehended for the people of his town; against the whole world, and did not protest, he is apprehended for the whole world.\" And they likewise said, \"<i>The Lord will enter into judgment with the Elders of His people and its princes</i> (Isaiah 3:14). If the princes sinned, what did the Elders do that was a sin? Rather, with the Elders because they did not protest against the princes.\" You have learned [from this] that a king is punished for the iniquity of the people, since he is not protesting against them; and the people as a whole are punished for the iniquity of the king, since they are not protesting against him. And this is an answer to that which King David asked, <i>but these sheep, what have they done</i> (II Samuel 24:17)?"

                "Even though the leader is most fit to protest and he is the one most fit to be punished, even those lesser than him will nevertheless be punished, since they have the ability to protest. It is just that the leader is punished more. And likewise with anything that is fit for them to pay attention to and they ignore it. And that is what they said (Shabbat 55a:2), \"Rav Yehuda was sitting before Shmuel. This woman came and cried before Shmuel [about an injustice that had been committed against her], and he paid no attention to her. He said to [Shmuel], 'Doesn’t the Master hold [in accordance with] what is written: <i>Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard</i> (Proverbs 21:13)?' He said to him, 'Your head [will be] with cold water. The head of your head will be with hot water.'\" That is to say, I, since I am your head, will be punished a little; but the one who is my head and the permanent head of the court will be punished more. \"That is Mar Ukva, who sits as head of the court, and it is written, <i>House of David, so says the Lord, 'Execute judgment in the morning'</i> (Jeremiah 21:12).\""
