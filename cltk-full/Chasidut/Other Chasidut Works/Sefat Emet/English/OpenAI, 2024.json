Therefore, the creation was done in such a way that man can learn the service of HaShem from everything. This is the meaning of \"He looked in the Torah and created the world\" – that in everything in creation, there is an aspect of the Torah from which we can learn behavior or a secret. The Torah boasts so that man will know that the main purpose of everything is the Torah, for the entire creation was made according to the Torah, proving that it is the primary good for mankind.",
                    "3": "The praise in the creation of the heavens and the earth, as it says, \"See who created these,\" is the wonder of how HaShem's energy can spread into physical things.

However, everyone requires HaShem's assistance, as it is stated, \"If not for HaShem's help...\" This applies even to Avraham. Avraham himself acknowledged this, saying, \"I walked before HaShem,\" and it was considered righteousness because he believed all his strength came from HaShem. Therefore, how can it be said that Avraham did not need support?<br>The explanation is that, indeed, everything comes from HaShem. Sometimes, HaShem provides help in a way that makes one dependent on support, while for those who are worthy, He provides help in a way that makes them appear self-sufficient. However, a person must always recognize that everything is from HaShem. For those who do not fully understand this, HaShem may not grant them this level of independence.",
                    "5": "Rashi explains that \"Remember the days of old\" refers to reflecting on the generations of the Flood and the Tower of Babel, where it is noted that \"they were one people with one language.\" It seems they lost their free will. Why did this happen? It was for the sake of Israel. HaShem, in His compassion for Bnei Yisrael, saw that they were mixed among these nations. Therefore, He said, \"They are one people.\" My grandfather, the Chidushei Harim, explained that \"one people with one language\" actually refers to Bnei Yisrael. Because of this, the other nations lost their free will.<br>The verse \"He set boundaries for the peoples according to the number of Bnei Yisrael\" means that the concealments faced by the seventy nations are proportionate to the strength of Bnei Yisrael, who can rectify and clarify these concealments. This division is \"according to the number of Bnei Yisrael.\" The distinction is that the free will of the nations can lead to complete destruction, but this is not the case for Bnei Yisrael. The primary idea is \"one people with one language.\"<br>There are two aspects: being united within Bnei Yisrael and engaging in Torah and prayer, which is the power of Israel through their words. This unity is essential for accessing the Torah, as stated, \"An inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.\" The more a person integrates into the collective of Israel, the more they merit understanding the words of Torah."

He explained that even the feeling of being small in one's own eyes is also a kindness from Hashem. It can further be said that through the kindnesses that Hashem has done for him, a person recognizes his own smallness. This is because, through the greatness of Hashem's kindness, a person comes to understand his own insignificance. I believe this has now been published in the book *Zikaron Zot*."

This is what is meant by \"and they swallowed... but it was not known.\" It seemed as if they had their own power, but this is not the case.<br>This was to show Pharaoh before the exile that even though Bnei Yisrael would be under his control, he still had no power against HaShem.

Indeed, it was through the butler that he was eventually released from prison. However, because Yosef mistakenly added, \"remember me,\" two more years were added to his imprisonment, and the butler did not remember him immediately. In contrast, someone who truly turns to the arrogant will have their desire fulfilled but will thereby sever their connection to HaShem."

It can be said that Yehuda knew that since he had guaranteed Binyamin's return, it was a sign that he would indeed be able to bring him back to his father.<br>Similarly, the guarantee of the Israelites, who accepted the Torah, means they should strengthen their faith in Hashem and believe that He will surely help them fulfill their commitment. As it is said, \"I have sworn, and I will uphold it, to keep Your righteous judgments.\" In the same way, all of Bnei Yisrael are guarantors for one another, and through this mutual responsibility, each person can help their fellow Jew, as explained in the mitzvah of helping with loading and unloading burdens. The term \"guarantee\" (ערבות) is related to the word \"mixture\" (תערובות), indicating that the guarantor is inherently connected to the matter at hand."

Bnei Yisrael need the two utterances, which represent complete acceptance with full devotion of heart and soul to purify themselves and connect to HaShem’s utterances.

When Bnei Yisrael clarify this through their own free will, the sanctity of HaShem rests upon their actions. However, if they forsake the mitzvah of Shemitah, HaShem is forced to demonstrate His power, showing that everything is His, leading to our exile from the land. The phrase “a Shabbos to HaShem” is only used when Shemitah is observed willingly by Bnei Yisrael, as mentioned above."

The difference between the Ten Utterances (ma'amarot) and the Ten Commandments (dibrot) lies in their function. An utterance represents the creative force that HaShem placed in the world, where He speaks and creation comes into existence. A commandment, however, signifies HaShem's ongoing supervision and governance over the creation as it exists, ensuring that nothing ever escapes His divine providence.<br>This distinction highlights the unique relationship between Bnei Yisrael and the nations. While all acknowledge that HaShem created everything, Bnei Yisrael understand that HaShem continuously renews and supervises creation every moment. This is the essence of \"dibur\" (speech). It is also the difference between humans and animals. As our sages say, \"You are called 'Adam,'\" meaning humans are distinct in their ability to bring their internal potential into action. Unlike animals, which act purely on instinct, humans articulate their thoughts and command actions through speech.<br>Bnei Yisrael are unique in their sacred speech, the words of Torah, which govern all creation. The Zohar states that in Egypt, speech was in exile, but with the giving of the Torah, the world's governance was rectified according to the Torah. This sacred speech, embodied in the Torah, empowers Bnei Yisrael to lead and influence all of creation.",
                    "4": "The Midrash explains the verse “Each man by his flag” (Bamidbar 2:2) and connects it to the idea that Bnei Yisrael desired flags, similar to the heavenly hosts. The analogy given is of a wine cellar, and the verse “His banner of love was over me” (Shir Hashirim 2:4). It also references “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the name of HaShem our G-d” (Tehillim 20:8).<br>HaShem established various levels and hierarchies in the higher worlds, enabling attachment and the flow of divine energy to all creations and nations. However, Bnei Yisrael are directly attached to HaShem Himself. Our sages say, \"The forefathers are the chariot,\" meaning their connection to HaShem is beyond the chariot. Bnei Yisrael desired to be connected to their supreme source, unlike other nations who seek vitality for themselves. Bnei Yisrael wish to nullify themselves to HaShem.<br>HaShem fulfilled their desire by giving them flags, symbolizing the higher realms in the heavens. The flags are a reflection of divine letters (the letters of HaShem’s name), as indicated by the four flags corresponding to divine attributes in sacred texts. This was in the merit of the forefathers, whose actions for their descendants ensure that when Bnei Yisrael follow their ways, they are aided by their merit.<br>The Midrash also notes that while some chose not to draw near, the forefathers brought themselves close to HaShem. Consequently, their descendants are drawn close even without explicit choice, due to their forefathers' merit. This is the meaning of “by the signs of their ancestral house” (Bamidbar 2:2), indicating a connection and continuation of the forefathers' ways. The phrase “His banner of love was over me” (Shir Hashirim 2:4) signifies that Bnei Yisrael can connect to levels beyond their own through their longing and desire, granted by HaShem’s love for them.",
                    "5": "In Avot 6:2, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says, \"Every day a heavenly voice goes out from Mount Horeb, lamenting the disgrace of the Torah, saying: 'Woe to the creatures who insult the Torah.' It also states, 'A beautiful woman without taste is like a gold ring in a pig's snout,' and 'There is no free person except one who engages in Torah study,' and 'From the wilderness, a gift, and from the gift, Nachaliel...'\"<br>This voice is the essence of the Ten Commandments, described as \"a great voice that did not cease\" (Devarim 5:19), which continues to reach Bnei Yisrael. As it is written, \"the Giver of the Torah,\" indicating an ongoing act. Since this voice is directed specifically at Bnei Yisrael, if they do not prepare themselves to receive it, it is considered an insult to the Torah. This is the meaning of the analogy \"a beautiful woman without taste,\" as Bnei Yisrael are uniquely suited to the voice of the Torah.<br>Even though there are many obstacles to drawing oneself closer to the Torah, it is said that through one's yearning for and desire to follow the Torah, it is given as a gift. Subsequently, one can become even more connected to the Torah, making it their inheritance, as the verse states, \"From the wilderness, a gift, and from the gift, Nachaliel.\"<br>This teaching emphasizes the ongoing nature of receiving the Torah and the unique relationship Bnei Yisrael have with it. Their preparation and desire are crucial for fully embracing and inheriting the Torah, transforming it from a gift into a personal and eternal inheritance.<br>"

This dual nature highlights the importance of faith in the sages (אמונת חכמים), foundational to Torah observance. The Mishnah emphasizes that ancestral teachings, inherited from Sinai, should not be questioned based on personal reasoning.<br>The Gemara (Pesachim 49b) interprets \"מורשה\" (inheritance) as \"מאורסה\" (betrothed), signifying that personal effort and commitment are necessary for Torah study. The phrase \"prepare yourself to study Torah, for it is not an inheritance for you\" (Pirkei Avot 2:12) applies to individuals, indicating that effort is required. However, for the collective of Israel, it is \"the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob,\" implying a communal legacy. By integrating into the collective, an individual can also merit a share in this inherited portion of the Torah, combining personal effort with communal inheritance for deeper understanding."
