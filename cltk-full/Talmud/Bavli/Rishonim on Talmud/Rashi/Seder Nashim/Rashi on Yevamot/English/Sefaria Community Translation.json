Regarding 'the house fell' it is said they divide because even when we say as if collected, we do not find for the creditor to equate with certainty more than the heirs since he was not established in these assets and this document emerges upon him and not upon the father therefore it is doubt and doubt whether if the father died first, it is found the creditor is certain of this document as if collected and the heirs are nothing, and if the son died first, the heirs are found certain and the creditor is nothing."
