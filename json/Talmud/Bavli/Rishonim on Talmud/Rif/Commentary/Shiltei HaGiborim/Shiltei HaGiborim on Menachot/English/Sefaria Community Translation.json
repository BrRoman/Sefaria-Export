            "One should write <i>Shin, dalet, yod</i> (the Omnipotent) on the back in the space between the two sections. And such is the practice in Germany and France, to write the name of four letters on the back corresponding to, \"the Lord is our God,\" [on the front side]. And they are those letters adjacent to Lord, God, in the <i>alpha beita</i> [letter substitution scheme] — <i>kaf, vav, zayin, vav</i>, [then] <i>bet, mem, vav, kaf, samech, zayin</i>, [and then] <i>kaf, vav, zayin, vav</i>. But nothing should be added on the interior, nor should any seals be made, as it [then] appears as if one intends to make a charm for protection. Rather, one should do the commandment as it is ordained to fulfill the word of the Creator, may He be blessed, and He shall guard us and save us with His right arm. To here [are the words of Riaz]. And likewise, did Rambam write, see there at length. And likewise, Semag, see there at length."
