        "13_Haftarah of Vayigash, 12_Paragraph": "<b>And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them:</b> It explains how it is that they should live [forever] naturally; that it is understood according to the verse that the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Pinchas (Numbers 25:12), \"behold, I give him My covenant of peace.\" For the matter of natural death is from the inferior quality of [man's] makeup. As he is not perfect in his composition, so that [his] components do not equally fit his makeup. So he acquires one of the circumstances [that compromise his health] that exist in the world and the days of old age and senescence come upon him, such that the body encounters deterioration. Yet the whole entire Torah is built upon guarding the body from [these] circumstances. And you should know that 'one who keeps the commandment does not know a bad thing.' And this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Pinchas, \"behold, I give him My covenant of peace.\" For it is peace among the components [of his body]. And that is why we say that Pinchas is Eliyahu and that Eliyahu lives and survives forever. So that is what it informs us here, \"And I will make a covenant of peace with them.\" And it is easy to understand."
