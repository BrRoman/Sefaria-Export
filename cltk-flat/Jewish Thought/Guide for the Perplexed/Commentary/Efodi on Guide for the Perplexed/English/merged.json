        "3_Part 2, 1_, 29_Chapter, 21_Paragraph": "When the serpent came to Eve, it cast impurity upon her. This means that when the imaginative power was impressed upon the human soul, it cast impurity upon her to pursue bodily desires. Israel, who stood at Mount Sinai, received the commandments, and were attuned to true opinions and warned against bodily desires, their impurity ceased, etc."
