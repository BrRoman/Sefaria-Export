                "<b>The final notebook:<br>And one needs to cover the head:</b> See Taz 3 on [Shulchan Arukh, Orach Chaim] Section 8, that one should be careful and not be bareheaded even outside of prayer [times], since the people understand it as lightheadedness and licentiousness. And it is fully forbidden now that it has become a practice among the idolaters always, as soon as they sit down, to remove the hat. And, if so, it is included in the category of <i>and you shall not follow their customs</i> [Leviticus 18:3], see there. And at the end of Shabbat [156b], \"Cover your head so that you will have the fear of Your master upon you.\" And likewise, in Kiddushin 33a, \"A certain man passed before him and did not cover his head. They said, 'How rude is this man, etc.'\" And it is found in Tractate Kallah about a certain infant who passed by the elders and his head was uncovered [that] Rabbi Eliezer said he was a <i>mamzer</i>, and Rabbi Yehudah said he was the son of a menstruant, and Rabbi Akiva said that he was a <i>mamzer</i> and the son of a menstruant. So he asked his mother, and she admitted to him that it was so. Hence one should distance himself from this more than from their other practices, see there.<br>And see Bekhor Shor (Shabbat), who wrote, \"I have seen those that are exacting, [that] even in the bathhouse, they place a cloth over the head. And I have practiced this from my youth,\" see there, and also see below in the addenda to Paragraph 249.<br>And in the book, Tzemach David, Part II, in the Fourth Millenium, he wrote, and these are his [words]: At the beginning of the Greek empire, there was a sage in Athens, the city of wisdom, and some say in Rome, and he would expound in public that people should remove their hats from upon their heads when they were working. And his reason was that earlier, the greatest humility was from those who would walk barefoot, like the matter that is stated, <i>and he was walking barefoot</i> (II Samuel 15:30). But since the head is more honored than the feet, there is more humility in showing the head than from showing the feet. And it is from this that the custom spread that someone lesser than his fellow, or even similar to him, should humble himself by showing and baring his head. However, this custom is only [found] among the Christians and not with anyone besides them. To here [are his words]."

                "<b>The reason:</b> Regarding the matter of blessing, that at the beginning, one speaks to God as if he is in front of Him, but in the end as if he is not in front of Him, it is because it is stated (Psalms 16:8), \"I have set the Lord always before me.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the <b>Zohar Chai</b> on Genesis, p. 168, he writes as follows: My holy teacher, our master the rabbi, our Rabbi <b>Avraham Yehoshua Heshel</b> of Apta testified about our holy rabbi, our master, Rabbi <b>Yaakov Yitzchak</b> of Lublin, that he would not even raise his eyelids without unifying [God's] name, all the more so [with] speech and all the more so [with] a response. And once my master, my beloved, the holy one, said, \"I was walking to the house of prayer with very enlightening tefillin, and I heard that they were calling in front of me, 'Give honor to his son, etc.' But when I came back from the house of prayer, I was holding a tobacco pipe without intent. And I heard them calling, 'Woe to x, who is rebelling against his Master.'\" As so is it found in the Tosefta, \"A person should not use face or his feet except for the glory of his Maker (<i>Konehu</i>)\" - he should 'make' (<i>koneh</i>) and unify Him (<i>Hu</i>, which also refers to a name of God); in the same way as, \"in all of your ways, know Him (<i>Hu</i>).\" And with righteous people like these, the shells will be finished, and it will be a favorable time.</i> So when he mentions the name and says, \"Blessed are You, Lord,\" it is as if he is in front of Him; but when he says, afterward, \"our God, King of the world,\" it comes out that he is not standing in front of Him. As it means to say [that] this God of ours, who is the King of the world, He has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to do them (Abudarham). And see the Shibulei HaLeket, Law 168: \"I have set the Lord always before me.\" Rav said, \"Blessed are You.\" Shmuel said, \"Blessed is He.\" Hence, our Rabbis established it like both of them - \"Blessed are You,\" like Rav, and \"who sanctified us,\" like Shmuel. See there."

                "<b>The Reason for the Four Parshiot (Special Torah Readings)</b> Three of them are in memory of the time that the Temple existed. And they are <b><i>Parshat Shekalim, Parshat Parah Adumah</i> and Parshat HaChodesh. For we announce [the obligation of] the shekel payment on the first of Adar.</b> As the Torah stated (Numbers 28:14), \"that shall be the monthly burnt offering for each new moon of the year.\" And from the oral tradition, they learned that it is meaning to say [it is to be] from the first of the month [of Nissan]. And it said monthly (<i>bechodsho</i>, which is related to the word for new), meaning to say, renovate and offer a sacrifice from the contribution of the new shekel coins. Hence we announce [it] one month before Nissan, so that each one can prepare his half [shekel coin], and all will be collected and brought to the Temple with the arrival of Nissan. And so when Adar begins during the days of the week, we bring up the announcement to the Shabbat before it. As if we delay it to the next Shabbat, there will not be a complete month until Rosh Chodesh (the first day of) Nissan. But when Rosh Chodesh Adar is on Shabbat, there is no need to bring it up, since there is surely a [whole] month. <b>And with <i>Parshat Parah Adumah</i></b>, it is to inform the people that are impure from [contact with] the dead that they should purify themselves with the ashes of the heifer. For the distant ones began to go up to Jerusalem on the first day of Nissan. Hence we do not take a break between <i>Parshat Parah</i> and <i>Parshat HaChodesh</i>. <b>And Parshat HaChodesh</b> is to inform the people that the first day of Nissan will be in the coming week, so that they will prepare themselves for the pilgrimage to the festival. <b>And Parshat Zakhor <i>The Pri Meggadim</i></b><i> wrote (282:3), \"Even though a minor counts for the tally of seven (that read from the Torah on Shabbat) and, in the time of the Talmud, a minor would go up and read on his own, <b>a minor that goes up for Parshat Zakhor</b> should not read [it] on his own. For behold <b>there are some that say that the reading of Parshat Zakhor is [mandated[ by the Torah</b>, so we would not fulfill [the commandment] with the reading of a minor. And see Taz 685:2.\"</i> is because of Purim. As Haman came from the seed of Amalek, and the Torah stated (Deuteronomy 25:17), \"Remember what Amalek did to you.\" And from the oral tradition, they learned that remembering is oral, etc. And we say in the Yerushalmi, \"It is proper that we should bring forward <i>Parshat HaChodesh</i> before <i>Parshat Parah Adumah</i>, since the tabernacle was established on the first of Nissan, and they burned the heifer on the second of it. So why did they say to bring forward the red heifer? Because it is the purification of the Jewish people, meaning from the impurity of the dead, so that they will not be pushed off until the Second Pesach.\" Abudarham."
