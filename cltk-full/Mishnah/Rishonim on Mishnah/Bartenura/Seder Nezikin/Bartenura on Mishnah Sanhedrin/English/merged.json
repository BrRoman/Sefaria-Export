                "4": "אבל אם הם כשרים ומומחים – This is how it should be understood: But if they were worthy in that they are neither relatives nor invalid, even though they sit on street corners, they became like specialists and he cannot invalidate them. The Halakhic decision on this is that when the litigants accepted who would judge them, whether for an individual or for the public, and he made a legal decision for them, his judgment is law and they cannot reverse his judgment even though he is not a specialist recognized by the public, and if it is known that he erred, if it is something from the Mishnah that he erred in or something explicitly written in the Gemara, they revoke the matter and re-judge it according to Halakha. But if it is impossible to revoke the matter such as the case that the person who took the money illegally went abroad, the judge is exempt form payment after they had accepted him [as judge] over them, for even though he caused for damage [to be done], he did not intend to cause damage. And if he had erred in his weighing between opposing views, and this is a matter that the Tannaim or Amoraim or Gaonim disputed about, but the general practice is like one off them, and the judge adjudicated like according to the words of that Gaon whose opinion was not like the general practice, if he did not engage in give and take by hand, he should retract the judgment, but if it is impossible to retract, he should pay from his own estate, and if he engaged in give-and-take by hand , what is done is done and he should pay from his own estate. But a judge whom the litigants did not accept but stood up on his own [to be a judge] or a king appointed him or some of the elders of the community appointed him, if he is not a specialist recognized by the public, even though he received permission from the Exilarch his judgments are not law, whether he erred or whether he did not err. And he is not amongst the judges but rather amongst those who act by force, and each one of the litigants if he wants, he reverses the decision and the judgment returns before the Jewish court. And if he erred and did not engage in give-and-take by hand, the judgment should be reversed, and if it is impossible to reverse it, he should pay from his estate according to the law of all who cause damage, and if he engaged in give-and-take by hand he should pay from his estate and return from what the litigant gave him which was not according to Halakha. But specialist recognized by the public whom the litigants accepted or that he received permission [to judge] from the Exilarch even though the litigants did not accept him, for such he is a specialist, if he erred in a matter whether from the Mishnah or from making a decision after weighing between opposing views, and it is impossible to reverse the decision, he is exempt from making payment. And a specialist who received permission from the Exilarch must force the litigants before him that they will adjudicate before him, whether they wanted to or did not want to, whether in the land of Israel or outside the land of Israel. And whomever received permission from the Nasi in the land of Israel cannot force the litigants other than only in the land of Israel. And he who is a specialist, is one who learned the Written Torah and the Oral Torah and knows how to think, to make analogies and to understand a thing from the midst of another thing (and he is called a specialist). And when he is recognized and known and his character/substance has gone out [and become known] among the men of his generation, he is called an expert recognized by the public, and he may judge singularly (i.e., alone) and even if he did not receive permission from the Exilarch.",

And the Rabbis think that even though he said at first: “I have two sets of witnesses,” he can retract and say “I do not have ought of these, and the person who comes to invalidate them is an interested witness but they are not invalidated by his mouth.

And they went back to call only those who do business with grain of the seventh year are ineligible [to serve testify] but those who collect grain of the seventh year to give to the king are valid for testimony, and since they don’t collect it to store for themselves. But with regard to Halakhic decision-making, whomever transgressed a sin which makes him liable for death by the Jewish court or extirpation or flogging, is ineligible for testimony. And those liable for death are called רשע/wicked, as it is written (Numbers 35:31): “[You shall not accept a ransom for the life of a person] who is guilty of a capital crime; [he must be put to death].” And regarding those who are liable for flogging, it is written (Deuteronomy 25:2): “And if the guilty one is to be flogged…” And the Torah stated (Exodus 23:10): “You shall not join hands with the guilty to act as a malicious witness.” And the Rabbis expound on “You shall not join guilty hands.” And if he is flogged, he returns to his validity [as a witness], as it is written (Deuteronomy 25:3): “Your brother be degraded before your eyes.” Since he was flogged, he is like your brother. And if he took money, not according to the law, even though he is not liable by it for death or flogging, he ineligible for testimony, such as a thief and a robber and one who lends at interest. But if he took monies which have a Rabbinical prohibition, he is Rabbinically ineligible for testimony, such as those who are dove-racers (i.e., pigeon-racers), and an extortioner who gave money and took an object that the owners did not want to sell, and the which the tax-collectors and the customs collectors , who took it for themselves, and those who receive tzedakah in public from the heathens, these and those like them are Rabbinically ineligible for testimony. And their testimony is not nullified until they announce about them and make them public knowledge. But those who are ineligible to testify from the Torah do not require announcement, and all who are ineligible to testify whether from the Torah or from their words (i.e., the Rabbis), if it is known from their affairs that they completely repented and the monies that they took illegally were returned and that they made a fence and a partition (i.e., a guard against transgressing the law) for themselves in that matter where they had sinned so that they would not add to do this any further; behold, these returned to the validity [for testimony]. But those who are dice players, even though there is now theft, even from their words (i.e., the Rabbis), they are ineligible for testimony, because they do not engage in the welfare of the world and lack the fear of heaven. And especially because they have no work or craft other than this, according to the words of Rabbi Yehuda. And this is the Halakha. And when is their return? When they break their dice and accept upon themselves that even for free they should not do this."
