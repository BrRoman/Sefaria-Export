                "And I say that it would have been possible to say that [wine that has been in contact with] the touch of those <i>anusim</i> [Jews forced to convert to Christianity] is forbidden to benefit from, and it is not even necessary to say that [so too] is their wine. And there is support for this from that which Rambam, may his memory be blessed, wrote in the Laws of the Foundations of the Torah (5:4): But if he could spare his soul and escape from under the hand of the wicked king and he does not, behold he is like a dog that returns to its vomit. And he is called one who worships idols willingly, and he is expelled from [reaching] the world to come, and he goes down to the lowest level of <i>Geihinnom</i>. To here are his [words].  And is it not something readily visible that the <i>anusim</i> were able to spare their souls and escape, as many of them did? Yet it is difficult to say this for many reasons. Hence, I will seek to advocate for their innocence and say that we most likely may not rely upon our opinion and say that they were already able to spare their souls, such that they are complete idolaters. Rather, we should ascribe their staying there to one of the situations of duress that are known to us: Perhaps it is because they lack the ability to put together the fare [demanded] by the ship owners since it is expensive. Or it is from fear for their lives, lest [their] sin will cause [calamity] and the matter be revealed, such that they will receive a punishment in their bodies and in their reputations. Or perhaps they have tried with all of their ability to escape, but it was a bad time and it did not go as planned, or some other thing prevented them. Whereas the words of Rambam stand when one of these reasons is not present, but rather when it is clearly known that he could have escaped but did not. Moreover, I say that even if it is [ostensibly] known to us that one has no fear of fleeing there, such as if that evil king proclaims in all of his kingdom that whichever one of you in all of my people [chooses to,] he may leave and let his God be with him — nevertheless we should not be concerned about this one who did not go, but stayed there, touching [wine]. And even though we say... (Ketuvot 51b), \"Rav Yehuda said, 'Those women stolen by kidnappers are permitted to their husbands, as everything they do for [their kidnappers], they do from fear. But if they release them and they go back to them on their own, they are certainly forbidden.'\" ... — we can nevertheless say that the case before us is not similar... Here, we can say that perhaps they are afraid that the permission given them is only to test them [and see] if they are [true apostates]. So if they flee, they will kill them...   "

                "Tunis. To Rabbi Yosef b. Abba, may God protect him. You have asked whether one may slaughter the offerings of the Ishmaelites (=Muslims) on their behalf and to eat from it.",
                "Response: The Ishmaelites are not idolaters, which would render their offerings the offerings of the dead (zivhei metim). This was stated by the Ge’onim. Although in the times of the Sages their offerings were offerings were the offerings of the dead, as stated in the third chapter of Hullin (38b) and the first chapter of Avoda Zara (32b), even though they were the offerings of the dead, if a Jew performed the slaughter, it is not forbidden, because we follow R. Yose, as stated there (Hullin 39b). ",
                "Nevertheless, it seems that it would be forbidden for a Jew to sacrifice their paschal lamb, because this is an established commandment for them, and we do not leave Noahides  to add on to their seven commandments. For it is stated in the chapter “Arba Mitot” (Sanhedrin 58b): “A Noahide who observes Shabbat is liable for death.” The same applies to any other commandment, as Maimonides wrote in the Laws of Kings (10:9). If so, how can a Jew slaughter on their behalf? He must prevent them! Indeed, the Sages stated (Avoda Zara 6b): “It is forbidden to hand to a Noahide a limb from a living animal; even though one does not transgress “placing a stumbling block before the blind” unless they are standing on opposite sides of the river,  as noted in the first chapter of Avoda Zara (ibid.), it is nevertheless forbidden to aid them, for indeed there is a duty to separate them [from the violation]. Tosafot stated similarly in the first chapter of Shabbat. And if this lamb is akin to the paschal offering, a commemoration of the Akeida,  then it is indeed a sacrifice. Non-Jews may offer sacrifices on their altars as long as it is not a fixed commandment. Therefore, if a Jew slaughters it, he is slaughtering sacred property outside the Temple precincts, and thereby incurs the punishment of extirpation (karet), even if the sacred property is the offering of a gentile. Similarly, one who eats from it is eating from sacred property outside of the Temple precincts. ",
                "Zevahim, in the chapter “Dam Hatat” (116b), the Talmud states: “Nowadays, gentiles may do so”—that is, they may sacrifice upon a private altar—“therefore, each one may build himself an altar and offer whatever he wants upon it. R. Yaakov b. Aha said in the name of R. Asi: But it is forbidden to assist them and act as their agents.” The Talmud only permitted instructing them how to perform the sacrifice in purity, as is stated there: “Rava said: It is permitted to instruct them.” Maimonides wrote the same at the end of the Laws of the Preparation of Offerings, and Ra’avad did not object that he wrote that the liability is karet even though the Talmud merely states that it is prohibited. ",
                "In the chapter “Ha-ba al Yevimto” (Yevamot 63b), it is said about the magi that came to Babylonia that they exhume the dead because there was rejoicing on their festivals. This implies that it is forbidden to rejoice with them on their festival, and we find no distinction in this regard between idolaters and those who are not idolaters. Therefore, even if this lamb would not be considered a sacrifice, the law would forbid dealing with [the gentiles] to join them in the slaughter and eating. Moreover, since they must slaughter their animals facing south, even on non-festival days, one who slaughters on their behalf incurs the penalty of lashes for violating “do not walk in the ways of the gentiles.”",
                "Rashba wrote in a responsum that it is proper to rebuke one who slaughters on an altar in the Ishmaelite custom. However, since they are not idolaters, one may do business with them prior to their festivals, as stated in the last chapter of Avoda Zara (65a): R. Yehuda sent an offering to the house of Adirban, and so too Rava sent an offering to the house of Bar-Shishak on his festival, saying that he knows for certain that Bar-Shishak is not an idolater. ",
                "An animal that a gentile purchased for this paschal offering may be bought from them [by a Jew], for even if it was bought to be offered to a pagan deity, it is not rendered forbidden, for a gentile cannot render something sacred by mere proclamation, as stated in the chapter “Kol Ha-tzelamim.” It is not considered set aside for pagan worship until [the animal] is fed from the cress of pagan practice, or handed to the priests, or shorn in the name of pagan practice, as stated in Temura, in the chapter “Kol Ha-asurin” (29a).

                "Question: One who immigrates to the Land of Israel and enters its border - are all of his sins, whether minor or major, forgiven with repentance? One who was on the way to immigrate to the Land of Israel and died on the way - does his worthy intention make it as if he had resided in the Land of Israel?",
                "Answer: Residing in the Land of Israel is a great mitzvah; the Ramban already listed it among the 613 mitzvot, and in the Sifrei (Devarim 80:5) our sages said settling the Land of Israel is equivalent to all of the commandments, as is written, “… and you shall possess it (the Land), and dwell in it. And you shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set before you this day (Devarim 11:31-32). And our sages (Ketubot 110b) already emphasized this by saying, “Anyone who resides in the Land of Israel is like one who has a Lord, as it is written, ‘I am G-d your Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your Lord’ (Leviticus 25:28).” And (Ketubot 111a): “Anyone who resides in the Land of Israel dwells without transgression, as it is stated: ‘And the inhabitant shall not say: I am sick; the people that dwell there shall be forgiven their iniquity.’ (Isaiah 33:24).” And (Ketubot 111a): Anyone who is buried in the Land of Israel is considered as though he is buried beneath the altar. It is stated here: “An altar of earth [adama] you shall make for Me” (Exodus 20:21), and it is stated there: “For He does avenge the blood of His servants, and renders vengeance to His adversaries, and atones for the land of [admato] His people” (Deuteronomy 32:43). And the sages of Israel (Ketubot 112a) would endanger themselves by crossing rivers in order to enter the Land of Israel saying, “This is a place where Moses and Aaron did not merit entering; who says that I will merit seeing this land?” And they would kiss the rocks of the Land of Israel and roll in its dust, as it is written, “For Your servants take pleasure in her stones, and love her dust.” (Psalms 102:15) And (Ketubot 111b) it is called “beauty in the Land of of the Living” (Ezekiel 26:20) - those who are buried there will not suffer the pain of “rolling tunnels,” but the righteous ones who are buried outside the Land do have this suffering, for the Creator makes them tunnels in the ground and (at the revival of the dead) they will roll from there to the Land of Israel and arise, as it is said, “may they blossom out of the city like the grass of the earth” (Psalms 72:16), and “city” means nothing other than Jerusalem, as it is stated: “For I will defend this city” (II Kings 19:34). And it is not permitted to leave the Land of Israel except to study Torah if one cannot find a teacher (in the Land), or to honor parents. ",
                "From all this (the answer to your question) becomes clear. Someone who repents and regrets his sins and wants to immigrate to the Land of Israel: repentance atones; immigration to the Land of Israel adds merit and saves him from sin all (the rest) of his days. And your question, if circumstances beyond his controlled stopped him, and he did not complete his mitzvah, is it still considered a merit for him, as if he did complete it - our sages have already said in the first chapter of Kiddushin (40a), “The Creator joins a good thought to an action, as it is stated: “Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with the other, and the Lord listened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that fear the Lord, and that think upon His name” (Malachi 3:16). What is the meaning of the phrase “and that think upon His name”? Rav Asi said: Even if a person intended to perform a mitzva but due to circumstances beyond his control he did not perform it, the verse ascribes him credit as if he performed the mitzva. And may the Omnipresent One help him with his goal, like the king of the Kuzars said to the rabbi when he left him to immigrate to the Land of Israel. (Kuzari 5:28)"
