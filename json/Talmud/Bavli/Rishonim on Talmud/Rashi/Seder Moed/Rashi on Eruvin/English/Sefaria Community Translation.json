Another interpretation: \"It is regarding its height that it is written,\" that the height of all the curtains of the courtyard surrounding [the Tabernacle] was 15 cubits, but we did not learn a measurement for the width of the entrance. And according to this interpretation, we read in the conclusion, \"that [verse] is from the edge of the altar and upward,\" since the altar's height was ten [cubits], and the curtains were five [cubits] higher than it, making them 15, so that a priest would not be standing on it with the [sacrificial] service in his hand, and all the people seeing him from outside. And I have heard both [interpretations], and this [second one] is the main one, and so it is explicitly stated in Zevachim in the chapter \"Kodshei Kodashim\" (Zevachim 59a). And the one who explains according to the first interpretation is mistaken, for he assumed that the one who objects, \"Let us learn from the doorway of the courtyard gate,\" objects regarding the height, to disqualify a height greater than five cubits. And for this reason, he turned back to establish the courtyard gate at a height of twenty [cubits]."

Thus is a delineation in entrances analogous to \"utilization beneath the beam.\"",

And it is established for us in every place that a partition which is not suitable for four [handbreadths] is not a partition, for there is no private domain less than four handbreadths, even if it is surrounded by a partition of ten handbreadths. And in the case of the balconies of Chananiah ben Akavia, we also say the same thing, that there are no partitions unless there are four [handbreadths] within the space, as [stated] in the chapter \"How do they share?\" (Eruvin 60b)."
