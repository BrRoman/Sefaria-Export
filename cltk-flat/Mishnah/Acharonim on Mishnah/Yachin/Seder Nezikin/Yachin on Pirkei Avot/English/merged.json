And so he received Torah from Sinai, the lowest of the mountains [Megillah 29a]. This teaches that only through humility, the source of all attributes of integrity, can one attain Torah.",
        "0_Chapter, 29_Seif, 0_Comment": "Nitai the Harbalite said, distance yourself from a bad neighbor. Because whether he is angry, arrogant, jealous, or similar, its not enough to not befriend him, in order not to learn from his actions since it will hurt your Soul, rather, distance yourself from him so it doesn't hurt your body.",
        "1_Chapter, 121_Seif, 0_Comment": "Rabbi Shimon says.  He enjoins three things regarding prayer, which also is in the category of avodah [service].",
        "1_Chapter, 122_Seif, 0_Comment": "Be careful about Sh'ma and the T'filah.  He does not mean that you should recite Sh'ma and should pray, or that you should not let the time limits lapse, for this is wholly obligatory, while this tractate deals solely with matters of piety.  Rather it enjoins, that since these are wholly obligatory, and one says them several times a day, it's common that one will not focus well on them, and therefore, the Tanna enjoins here that one should take care to focus well on them.  Sh'ma, because in it, one repeats to oneself all of the essentials of our holy faith.  Specifically, in the first passage, the unity of God, blessed be He, the love of Him, the awe of Him, and the study of Torah, which consists of one's obligations to the Holy One, blessed be He.  The second passage has the faith in Torah from Heaven, the observance of its mitzvot (as it begins, \"If, then, you obey ... that I enjoin ....\"), and also the faith in providence of reward and punishment in this world, and also a reference to reward and punishment in the next world (as it concludes, \"so that you ... may endure, ... as long as there is a heaven over the earth,\" which is impossible without the world to come, in other words, you should fulfill mitzvot only for this purpose, and not for purposes of this world).  The third passage is an additional injunction not to go astray after the temptations of the evil inclination, of appetite or of heretical thoughts, as it is said, \"you must not go astray after your mind -- i.e., the evil inclination -- or after your eyes -- i.e., erroneous thoughts, for all sins in the world will be through these two.  And since all of these matters in these passages are basic for the Jewish line and positive for the world, the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded us to go over them every day.  And if a person nevertheless says them without focusing, all of what the person says is for naught.  And similarly with the prayer, aside from the fact that, in all of them [the brachot], the person speaks to the King, as it says, \"Blessed are You,\" and how can one have the effrontery to be so, the mouth and the mind not being in accord?  Also, even aside from this, how can one think that Adonai will accept one's prayer if one does not plead before Him very abjectly, and instead, one's thoughts are flying to all corners of one's foolishness and delusions, and perhaps even to matters of sin.  And how can one not be ashamed to say, at the end of the prayer, before the One who knows thoughts, \"May [the words of my mouth and] the meditations of my mind be acceptable\" -- how would one respond if Adonai were to answer with a rebuke, \"What were you meditating now in your mind?\"  Therefore, our Sages said, \"A person's prayer is not heard unless the person's soul is placed in the person's hand\" -- the soul is the thoughts, and the hand means that the person attends to [the thoughts] closely so that they will not wander and so that \"you will not forget before Whom you stand,\" as it says (Lam. 3:41), \"Let us lift up our minds with our hands to God in heaven.\"\n",

        "1_Chapter, 124_Seif, 0_Comment": "Don't make your prayer fixed [keva].  Praying only according as the words are ordered and fixed, thinking that that is your obligation.",
        "1_Chapter, 125_Seif, 0_Comment": "Rather, compassions and pleadings before the Omnipresent.  To pray with pleading, like a poor person who stands at the king's door, with a broken mind.  And therefore innovate each day in each bracha, according as your soul pours out on you.  ",
        "1_Chapter, 127_Seif, 0_Comment": "Do not be evil before yourself.  For this is also a major obstacle to focusing in prayer, when one thinks of oneself as evil before oneself and thus despairs of compassion, and thinks that all of one's prayers will not avail one.",
        "5_Chapter, 34_Seif, 0_Comment": "<b>Each and every day a [heavenly] echo (lit., daughter of a sound) goes out from Mount Horeb</b> The [scholars] in the books of [geography] have said that the sound of an echo – like the sound of thunderous words that no one can understand – is constantly heard around Mount Sinai in the air above the mountain even today  . And this is a wondrous thing. And in my humble opinion, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is hinting to these. Since the sounds that are heard there hint to man to remind him of the giving of the Torah; and that it thunders now about the generation that does not honor it properly to observe its commandments properly. And this is the small sound that reverberates from the great sound that was heard then on the day of the gathering at the time of the giving of the Torah. And this is the \"daughter of a sound\" that is mentioned here; meaning to say a sound born of another sound."
