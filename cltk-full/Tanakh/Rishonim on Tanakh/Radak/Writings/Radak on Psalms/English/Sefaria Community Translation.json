Rather, it is since the good of the world to come is compared to the Garden of Eden, which is a place in the world. In order to make the listeners understand, it is said by way of a metaphor, just like the punishment of the evil is called Gehinnom, which is a place in the world near Jerusalem. And it was a disgusting place, and all the impurities and carcasses were dumped there, and there was a constant fire there to burn the impurities and the bones of the carcasses. That is why the punishment of the wicked is called Gehinnom by way of a metaphor. So the reward of the righteous is called the Garden of Eden, which is the most desirable place in the world. And it is called, <i>the land of the living</i>, because Adam was penalized with death when he was expelled from there. And the words of our rabbis, may their memory be blessed (Berakhot 4a): Why do dots appear over <i>were it not</i>? (So) Said David before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe. I have every confidence in You that You grant an excellent reward to the righteous in the future to come, but I do not know whether or not I have a portion among them; perhaps [my] sin caused [that I should lose it].
