Now, the explanation is 80 full days and nights and morning of Yom Kippur which is the 10th of Tishrei he went down and established that day as Yom Kippur to inform then that [Hashem] had forgiven and had mercy on the bad thing that he said he would do to his nation; therefore Yom Kippur was established on the 10th of Tishrei.
