            "\tThey found one jar [of oil] sealed with the seal of the High Priest. I have already elaborated on this matter in various writings, and I will record here what appears clear to me: Indeed, the impurity of contact with the dead (טומאת מת) is permitted in communal offerings. However, the Sages decreed that non-Jews are to be treated as having the impurity of a zav (טומאת זב), and the impurity of a zav is not overridden for communal purposes. The sages of the generation were perplexed about what to do—whether to uphold their decree at the expense of cancelling the lighting of the menorah or not. Then the Holy One, Blessed be He, performed a miracle, and the oil burned for eight days without needing to cancel the lighting of the menorah. From this, they saw a sign from Heaven that there was Divine approval for the enactments of the Sages. This strengthened the religion and the Oral Torah. For a more detailed discussion of this, see later."
