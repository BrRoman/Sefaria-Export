            "In that the perfection of man lies in knowing and understanding the beings, it is even more essential to first know and understand his own essence, and not be ignorant of understanding himself. Indeed, this understanding is not easy, for not many are wise in this matter, which is the comprehension of one’s own level. Even though it seems easy in terms of the nature of this comprehension—since one merely needs to open their eyes to find it, as it is not far away nor in the heavens to recognize the value of one’s own existence, which is the closest thing to oneself—most people will comprehend this incorrectly. They compare themselves to the ancients and say that they too have insight, and the former days are no better than these, because the wisdom that the Creator implanted comes from one source, as the individuals of the species are one. This stumbling block lies before them."
