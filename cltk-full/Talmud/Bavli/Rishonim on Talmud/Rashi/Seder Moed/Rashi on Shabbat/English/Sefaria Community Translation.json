And this teaching is taught in Torat Kohanim. And it holds that they were laying east to west. And so was it taught before it (Sifra, Emor, Section 13:7), \"'To raise a light always' - so that the western light [burn] continuously, as he would begin with it and end with it.\" And since it is not written, \"to raise lights\" - we understand from this that one lamp is fixed, to begin with it every day. And that is the western lamp - the second one from the east. And thus do we learn (Tamid 33a), \"He entered. [If] he found the two eastern lamps burning, he would remove the ash from the easternmost lamp. But he would leave the western lamp burning, as from that lamp he would kindle the candelabrum in the afternoon. If he found that it was extinguished\" - such as when Shimon the Just died -  \"he would kindle it from the altar of the burnt offering.\" And it appears in my eyes that the Rabbis said that its being fixed was the second lamp, was because we do not pass over commandments. But when he came to the [Temple] chamber, he first encountered the first [lamp], yet he could not begin with it, since it is written, \"shall arrange it [...] before the Lord.\" [Still] there needs to be one external to it. For, if not, we do not call it, \"before the Lord.\" And thus do we say in Menachot (98b), \"It is written about the western lamp, 'before the Lord.' This implies all [the others] are not before the Lord, etc.\" And he would finish the ordering with it. For he would order the rest in the morning, but he would order this one in the afternoon. And he would hold the old one in his hand or place it in a vessel until he would place the oil and wick and light, and [then] light the others from it. And that which we say in Seder Yoma (33b) - \"The arranging [of the candelabrum] is five lamps before the two lamps,\" implies that he would arrange all of them in the morning; and it learns this from verses - that is when no miracle existed, and he would find that it had been extinguished. For the verse does not rely on a miracle. But all the time that Israel was beloved, it would burn the whole day. And that is its testimony.",
