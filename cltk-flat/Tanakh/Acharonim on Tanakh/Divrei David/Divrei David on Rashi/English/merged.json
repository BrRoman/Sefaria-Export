        "4_Numbers, 32_Chapter, 54_Verse, 1_Paragraph": "*“And they shall harass you”—as the Targum translates, this requires explanation: what did it clarify here, since in Parashat Pinchas it is also written, “For they harass you,” and the Targum translates it the same way as here? Moreover, why does Rashi emphasize “you,” since his explanation is on the word “harass”?",
        "4_Numbers, 32_Chapter, 54_Verse, 2_Paragraph": "It seems that the word צררו (harass) has two meanings:",
        "4_Numbers, 32_Chapter, 54_Verse, 3_Paragraph": "\t1.\tOne meaning refers to causing distress, such as inflicting suffering through beatings and other troubles. In this sense, the proper wording would be “to you” (לכם) rather than “you” (אתכם), as seen earlier in “For they harass you” (צוררים הם לכם), and similarly in “When you are in distress” (בצר לך), which does not say “when you are in distress yourself” (בצר אותך).",
        "4_Numbers, 32_Chapter, 54_Verse, 4_Paragraph": "\t2.\tThe second meaning is similar to “when you besiege a city” (כי תצור על עיר), meaning to surround it from the outside and prevent escape. In this case, the appropriate phrasing would be אתכם (you) rather than לכם (to you), since it implies direct action against the subject.",
        "4_Numbers, 32_Chapter, 54_Verse, 5_Paragraph": "At first glance, we might interpret the verse here according to the second meaning, since it says אתכם rather than לכם. However, this is incorrect because a siege implies that the enemy is outside and encircling those inside, whereas here, the enemy is mixed among them, since they dwell in their midst as long as any remain. Therefore, the meaning must be as in the first interpretation—one of suffering—and אתכם here functions similarly to לכם.",
        "4_Numbers, 32_Chapter, 54_Verse, 6_Paragraph": "This aligns with the Targum, which translates it as “they will distress you” (ויעיקון לכון), rather than using a phrase implying direct action against them (יתכון).",
        "4_Numbers, 32_Chapter, 54_Verse, 7_Paragraph": "This also explains why in Parashat Pinchas, Rashi did not comment, since there the phrase explicitly says צוררים הם לכם (“for they harass you”), which clearly follows the first interpretation. However, here, where the wording אתכם requires clarification, Rashi needed to address the issue.",
        "4_Numbers, 32_Chapter, 54_Verse, 8_Paragraph": "This seems to be Rashi’s clear intent.*"
