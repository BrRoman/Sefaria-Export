                "But behold, if we examine [it], for example, with the claim against our mother Sarah that she listened from the opening of the tent, we will find that it it very, very slight. What did Sarah's ears hear? The conversation of the angels that were sent from God, may He be blessed, to announce to her that a son would be born to her, which are prophetic words. And there is a certainly a very high level in this, and only a prophet is fit to hear words like these from the mouths of supernal angels. And not only that, but the words were concerning her, that she would bear a son. And the listening was also unintentional; for the ears are one of three things that are not in the control of a person (see Tanchuma, Toldot 12). And indeed Sarah did not descend from her level of extra understanding that was given to her beyond that of a man as a result of this. For behold even after this story, it was said to Avraham, \"everything that Sarah says, listen to her voice\" (Genesis 21:12). And the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (see Rashi there), \"We learned [from this] that Avraham was secondary to Sarah regarding prophecy.\" So it then comes out that there was a blemish here that is beyond our ability to comprehend. And it is only the Holy One, blessed be He, who examines hearts and evaluates thoughts, who discovered that there was some lack with this, such that she did not reach her full perfection, according to her level."

                "However it is not only the trait of ingratitude that is the root of heresy and of all the destructive actions. Rather, it is all of the [bad] character traits. And even at the time when the Jewish people sinned with idolatry, they were only prosecuted on account of [their] defective character traits: We have seen with the sin of the calf that God said about it to Moshe (Exodus 32:8), \"they have made for themselves a molten calf, and have prostrated themselves to it and offered sacrifices to it.\" Nevertheless, when He came to punish them, it is written (Exodus 32:9), \"And the Lord said to Moshe, 'I have seen this people, and behold they are a stiff-necked people.'\" Note surely that the main sin of idolatry is not in the actual idolatry, but rather in the character trait that brought it into motion.",
                "And not only that, but if the character traits are proper, there can not be guilt for idolatry at all: The Sages, may their memory be blessed, said (Yalkut Shimoni on Torah 62:7), \"Peace is great. For even if the Jewish people would worship idolatry, but there is peace among them, He, as it were, cannot touch them. As it is stated (Hosea 4:17), 'Ephraim is addicted to images, let him be.' But when they are divided, what does is state? 'Their heart is divided; now they shall be found guilty' (Hosea 10:2).\" Behold from here, that the guilt of idolatry only took effect in the case when they had inferior character traits, and their hearts were divided from one another. But if their character traits are proper and they have friendly relations, even if it is for the sake of idolatry, the Trait of Strict Justice cannot touch them."

And even before He formed Adam the first man, He prepared all the pleasures on earth for him, “so that he could go straight into the meal” (Sanhedrin 38a) [such that he would find everything ready and eat what he would want (Rashi, there). And even the first and only command that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Adam was, <i>From every tree of the garden, you shall surely eat</i> (Genesis 2:17).  It was only from one tree – the tree of knowledge of good and evil – that He forbade him to eat. And likewise, all the commands of the Torah to man are to give him pleasure and joy. And the Torah even only commanded just one day a year to fast. That is to say, a man should eat and drink every day of the year except for one day. "

                "And it was not only in the time of Adam the first man. For we also find the Nephilim on the earth after several generations in the period before the flood. For the sages, may their memory be blessed, say (Bereishit Rabbah 26:7) about them that they called them giants [<i>anakim</i>] because they would wear [<i>aonkim</i>] the sun as a necklace. And why did they call them Nephilim? As they were angels, but because they prosecuted the generation of the flood, they fell [<i>naflu</i>] and came down to earth, so that they were a mix of people and angels. On the one hand, they were on the face of the earth like people; but on the other hand, they had the ability to ascend to heaven. And it is recounted about one of them that he saw a young woman, the name of whom was Istahar: He cast his eyes upon her. He said to her, \"Listen to me [to have intercourse].\" She said to him, \"I will not listen to you until you teach me [God's] explicit name with which you ascend to the firmament when you mention it.\" He taught her the name, and she mentioned it and [immediately] arose to the firmament. But she did not sully [herself]. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, \"Since she separated from sin, go and fix her among these seven stars so that you can always merit through them.\" (Yalkut Shimoni on Torah 44:1) Behold that there is a power in man, if the secret in the thing is revealed to him, to arise to heaven and to establish his dwelling there, since this is [the way of] his actual creation, as it is said, and his head reaches heaven [alluding to Genesis 28:12]. And, if so, then it is incumbent on each person to see himself as a man of heaven whose place is among the angels. And because of the trait of civility, it is incumbent upon him to always act like the creatures of heaven, which are the angels above, and to act like their actions. "

He tested David with flocks and found him a fine shepherd, as it is stated: 'He took him from the sheepfolds [<i>mikhleot tzon</i>]' (Psalms 78:70). What are <i>mikhleot tzon</i>? It is like: 'The rain was restrained [<i>vayikkaleh</i>]' (Genesis 8:2). He would hold back the large ones [sheep] due to the small ones, and would take out the small ones so they could graze on the soft grass, then the old ones so they could graze on the middling grass, then he would take out the choice ones to graze on the tough grass. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘One who knows how to herd the flocks, each according to its ability, will come and herd My people.’ That is what is written: 'From the suckling ewes He brought him, to herd Jacob His people' (Psalms 78:71). Moses, too, the Holy One blessed be He tested him only with flocks. Our Rabbis say: When Moses, may he rest in peace, was herding Yitro’s flock in the wilderness, a kid fled from him. He pursued it until it reached cover. Once it reached cover, it happened upon a pool of water, and the kid stopped to drink. When Moses reached it, he said: ‘I didn’t know that you were running due to thirst. You are tired.’ He carried it on his shoulder and was walking. The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘You have the compassion to behave with the flocks belonging to flesh and blood in this manner; by your life, you will herd My flock, Israel.’ That is: 'Moses was herding.'” (Shemot Rabbah 2:2)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">*</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Translation adapted from the Sefaria Midrash Rabbah, 2022.</i> ",
                "Behold that God tests the righteous to know if they are fit to be leaders, according to their leadership over animals, to what extent they delve into their needs and know how to provide for their betterment. Once King David, peace be upon him, distinguished between the specific requirements of all the types of sheep, each one according to its strength - and organized that the young sheet graze first while there is still soft grass, and the adult ones graze afterward since they have the ability to also eat the harder [grass] - the Holy One, blessed be He, found him fit to be the shepherd and leader of the people as well. And likewise, Moshe, our teacher: As he followed the kid in order to determine what the reason was for its running away. And after he determined that it was tired and thirsty, he had mercy upon it and placed it upon his shoulders. This revealed that he understood and examined the needs of every creature; so the Holy One, blessed be He, found him fit to be the shepherd of the Jewish people. But why did He test them specifically in their relationship to animals? Because from that, the trait of kindness and mercy that they were graced with was revealed. And is it not written concerning the Holy One, blessed be He (Psalms 145), \"and His mercy is upon all of His creations,\" to include all of the creatures? (See Bava Metzia 85 with the story about Rabbi with the calf and with the young weasels.) And it is also written (Psalms 145), \"The eyes of all hope towards You, and You give them their food in its time,\" as He concerns Himself for each one individually, according to its needs and time. Hence, only a person who goes in the ways of God and also has mercy upon all of the creatures and knows to distinguish and delve into the ways of each of them can stand this test and be fit for the task of being a shepherd and leader.
