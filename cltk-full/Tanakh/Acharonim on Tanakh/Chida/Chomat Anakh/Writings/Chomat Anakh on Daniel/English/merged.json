It is possible to say, as mentioned in Masechet Ta'anit, that wisdom is esteemed in vessels that are unattractive, and this is the greatness of Jerusalem because its sons were beautiful and wise, which was not found in other countries. This is explained by Rabbi Peri Chadash z\"l in Masechet Kiddushin, that ten kavim of wisdom descended to the world, nine were taken by other places, and Jerusalem took one. Similarly, ten kavim of beauty descended to the world, nine were taken by other places, and Jerusalem took one, as we say in Masechet Ta'anit: If they were hated, they were learned, even more than this. Rabbi Yehoshua says: Jerusalem had two hidden treasures, nine kavim of beauty and nine kavim of wisdom. The Gemara asks: What is the reason? If they were hated, they would have been learned even more. And this is why Nebuchadnezzar asked to bring those who were good-looking and intelligent in all wisdom, as it was difficult to match them together, and it is inevitable that those who hate beauty would also hate wisdom. So according to their nature, they hate beauty and wisdom, and furthermore, they hate beauty. And behold, they are in a threesome.",

Because if they are taught initially and later it is known that they do not have the strength to stand, the king's desire will not be fulfilled in them. What benefit is there in teaching them? Therefore, it says, 'And those who have strength in them,' and so on, to teach them.\""

For regarding appearance, it depends on the joy of the heart, as stated in Nedarim, page 49b, concerning Rabbi Yehuda, who had radiant countenance even though he was under duress at the time, and also they, in their joy, not to defile themselves, their appearance would be good. However, regarding being healthier in flesh, naturally, vegetarian food does not cause bloating or fattening, and he did not want to rely on miracles. But God, in His mercy, made their appearance better and their flesh healthier than all the children of their age. So wrote from there our Rabbi, Rabbi Moshe Alshich."
