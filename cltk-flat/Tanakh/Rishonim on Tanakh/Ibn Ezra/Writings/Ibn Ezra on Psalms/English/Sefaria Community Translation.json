And others say that Heman and Ethan were brothers whose father was called Ezrah.",
        "1_, 117_Chapter, 18_Verse, 0_Comment": "He who was rescued, he is obligated to thank Him. This is righteousness.",

[and I will continue] to discipline you...\" (Vayikra 26:18), and the ה is added because it serves for that which is after. \"For it is good to sing of God, for it is pleasant and desirable\" - [this word נאוה] is from the morphology of the word תאוה (desire), as I have explained, for the word is in the נפעל (passive) conjugation, like [it says] \"...and all that is made in a frying pan...\" (Vayikra 7:9).",

And Rabbi Yitzchak the Spaniard says that [this phrase is referring] to [how God \"bandages\" and fashions] their design, like the expression used by Yishmael and others like him: \"Your hands designed me...\" (Iyov 10:8). And in my opinion, [the meaning is] that He is like one who touches them, that he touches that which is very saddening for them."
