            "20": "And if a non-Jew [made it, etc.], and Rabbi Eliezer said, etc., and the form of the sun, etc. This means even to allow them to remain. These are the words of the Tur, in line with the Rosh there, who writes that the concern about \"suspicion\" (of idol worship) applies only to those forms that are forbidden to create. These include the form of a human, four faces, and those representing the celestial and earthly realms, as well as those forbidden even if found by chance, like the form of a dragon. This is also stated in Tosafot in the passage beginning with \"That is different.\" However, other forms are permitted both to create and to retain.  The Ramban and Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg disagree, explaining that the concern about \"suspicion\" also extends to other forms of animals, beasts, and birds. In those cases, there is a distinction between raised (protruding) and engraved (sunk) forms: engraved forms are permitted to create and retain, but the forbidden forms mentioned above are prohibited even if engraved, whether made by Jews or non-Jews.  As for rings with images, for forms other than those of the lower realm, although it is forbidden by the Torah to create them, it is permitted to retain them if made by others, provided they are engraved. This is what is meant in the text, \"The Torah only forbids [images] in the higher realm.\" Then, it challenges this by asking, “And those of the lower realm?” and answers that the case of Rabbi Gamliel is different because others made them, affirming Abaye's statement that only images of the higher realm are forbidden to retain.  The Ran also rules accordingly. The Rambam's view is that \"suspicion\" applies only to human images, suggesting he did not include in the Gemara the text \"And are we concerned about suspicion up to ‘and if you say to study’” (see further, note 27). This is also the position of the Rif, who omitted this and only mentioned cases for educational purposes.  The Raavad and Ran appear to interpret Rambam as being stringent with images of the heavens, prohibiting even engraved forms from being retained. They questioned where Rambam derived this ruling, as his words only prohibit creating these forms, even if engraved, but do permit engraved images of humans based on the rule for rings.     (Collected) Note on what was mentioned previously, that Rambams’ opinion is that objects that resemble sacred elements such as a house modeled after the Temple, or human images, or the four faces, or those representing the higher realm—all are prohibited by Torah law both to create and to retain, as it is written, \"Do not make for yourselves,\" which applies both to Jews making them for others and to others making them for Jews. However, objects representing the lower realm are not prohibited by Torah law except for their creation, but their retention is permitted. This is what Abaye meant when he said, \"The Torah did not forbid [such images],\" thereby excluding the lower realm from the prohibition. The one who questioned this was of the opinion that even making them was forbidden, to which the answer was that the case of Rabbi Gamliel is different.Abaye then stated that the Torah only forbade the higher realm. Other forms are permitted both to create and to retain according to Torah law. Any prohibition from the Torah applies to both raised (protruding) and engraved (sunk) forms, while anything permitted by the Torah is permitted in both types since, according to Torah law, there is no distinction between raised and engraved forms. However, rabbinic law prohibits any other forms that are raised, both to create and to retain, due to suspicion of idol worship. This same suspicion applies to objects of the lower realm, which are permitted by Torah law to retain, but rabbinically are prohibited if they are raised, due to suspicion. As it is said in the case of a ring, any ring with engraved images and other forms. Yet Ramban wrote that suspicion only applies to honored forms, while the Ran wrote that suspicion applies only to those that non-Jews customarily worshiped in that period. Therefore, in our time, all forms not forbidden by the Torah are permitted, even if they are raised. The opinion of Tosafot and the Rosh [see there] is that Torah law prohibits only creating the forbidden images, such as a house modeled after the Temple, human images, the four faces, and those representing the higher and lower realms, and specifically raised forms; and in the lower realm, even engraved forms.According to rabbinic law, it is prohibited even to retain those images that are forbidden to create, due to suspicion stemming from the act of creating them. Rabbinic law further prohibits the image of a dragon, due to suspicion of idol worship, if it is raised, both to create and to retain. All other forms are permitted by all authorities. (End quote)"
