It seems to me that he composed this song at the dedication of his own house, the House of Cedars, because the psalm does not mention the House of God. This usage is similar to “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house,” (Samuel II 5:8) as I explained there. At that time David fell sick and then recovered from his sickness. R’ Moshe said that David mourned when Natan told him that he would not build the house for the Lord. When he told him that Shlomo his son would build the house he was clothed with joy in place of his mourning because his son was like him, and his enemies could not disparage him. And he said that suffering of the soul is similar to physical suffering, and even worse in the sense that “A man's spirit will sustain his illness…” (Proverbs 18:14)"
