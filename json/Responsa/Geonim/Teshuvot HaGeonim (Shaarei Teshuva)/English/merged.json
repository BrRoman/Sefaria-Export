                "A public mezuzah is checked twice in a Jubilee [50 years], and a private mezuzah once in seven years, and that is a law. A private mezuzah is a mezuzah in the home of any person. A public mezuzah is a mezuzah at the gate of a large city. And we check it, lest the writing got smudged or the parchment got erased or rotted, in the same way we check tefillin. And it is a law that a house that has two or three entrances needs a mezuzah for every single entrance, and this is even if one is more accustomed to one of them than all of the others. And a storehouse that is connected to a house requires a mezuzah, both in that entrance and in every other entrance that it has. For it is clearly learned [in a baraita],  \"It is one for the gates of houses, and the gates of courtyards, and the gates of cities, and the gates of towns, and a barn, and chicken coops, and a hay storehouse, and wine storehouses, and oil storehouses, all of them are obligated in the commandment of mezuzah.
