        "12_Netiv Halashon, 1_Chapter, 0_Paragraph": "Since man was created as a physical being and\nnot just as a pure, disembodied soul, his pure\nsoul alone is not his complete essence. [In other\nwords, neither soul nor body alone represents the\nessence of the human being.]\nRather, the essence of man is his power of speech\n[for it combines these two components], which\nis expressed by the physical organ of the tongue.\nFor man is composed of both a physical [body]\nand a soul. Speech is unique to man, since\nno animal can speak. Speech is rooted in the\nsoul [and yet is found in a physical organ] and\ntherefore is the essence of man [since it combines\nthe physical and the spiritual]."
