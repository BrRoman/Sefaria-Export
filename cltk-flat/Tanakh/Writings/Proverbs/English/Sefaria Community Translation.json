        "6_Chapter, 21_Verse": "\"He follows her suddenly, like an ox going to the slaughter, and like a (dog) bound, towards the commands of a fool.\" [Targum: like a dog to its chains. The term 'כְעֶכֶס' can imply a collar or anklet, symbolizing binding. Rashi explains, to the venom of a snake; meaning the snake is drawn inescapably toward the prodding of its charmer and releases its poison in anger.]\n",
        "18_Chapter, 15_Verse": "..מַלְוֵ֣ה יְ֭הֹוָה ח֣וֹנֵֽן דָּ֑ל וּ֝גְמֻל֗וֹ יְשַׁלֶּם־לֽוֹ.",
        "21_Chapter, 5_Verse": "Thorns and snares are in the path of the perverse; he who guards his soul will distance himself from that."
