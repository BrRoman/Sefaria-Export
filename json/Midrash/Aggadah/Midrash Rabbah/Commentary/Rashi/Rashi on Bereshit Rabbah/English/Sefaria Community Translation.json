                "Just as they [the righteous] are faultless (תמימים), so their years are also faultless. The verse could have said “127 years,” but instead it breaks it into segments: “A hundred years, twenty years, and seven years.” This teaches: At the age of 100, she was like a 20-year-old in terms of beauty, and at the age of 20, she was like a 7-year-old in terms of being without sin....",
                "“The Lord knows the days of the faultless” (Psalms 37:18) – this refers to Sarah. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: She was like a perfect, unblemished calf (עגלתא תמימתא).",
                "“Their inheritance will last forever” – Why does the verse repeat “the years of the life of Sarah” after already stating, “And the years of Sarah’s life were”? It comes to teach you that the lives of the righteous are precious before the Holy One, Blessed be He, both in this world and in the World to Come.<br> Therefore, the Torah mentions “the life of Sarah” twice, to show that she merited both life in this world and eternal life in the World to Come. As it is written: “The Lord knows the days of the faultless,” referring to Sarah’s life in this world, “and their inheritance will last forever,” referring to her eternal life in the World to Come."
