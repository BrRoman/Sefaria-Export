        "2_Holidays, 1_Shabbat Teshuvah, 3_Chapter, 1_Paragraph": "...With regard to the 13 Attributes of Divine Compassion that we say: Rashi comments on Parashat Ki Tissa (Ex. 33:19) that YHVH said to Moses, \"You see me wrap myself [in a tallit] and call out the 13 Attributes; and you must teach the Israelites to do the same.\" Why did YHVH need to do so, call out Godself? Why was it not enough to command that the prayer leader wrap in a tallit and call out?",
        "2_Holidays, 1_Shabbat Teshuvah, 3_Chapter, 2_Paragraph": "...We find that the Kedushat Levi (Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev, 1740-1809) comments, “In each member of the people of Israel there is a portion of divinity. And when one calls out and prays with this divine portion, then the divine portion itself is calling out to YHVH. This is the meaning of ‘YHVH, YHVH’ [in the verse]: that YHVH [within the person] calls out to YHVH.”",
        "2_Holidays, 1_Shabbat Teshuvah, 3_Chapter, 4_Paragraph": "In truth, the essence of prayer is always dependent on whether YHVH is praying. As the Talmud says, “How do we know that the Holy Blessed One prays?” (Brachot 7a) We should say that it is always through the prayer of the individual Jew that the Holy Blessed One prays. If not, what use would a person’s prayer be—a prayer that is made up of human language? How could it change the Divine will from anger to compassion? ",
        "2_Holidays, 1_Shabbat Teshuvah, 3_Chapter, 5_Paragraph": "But that divine portion within a person does not always pray. It only prays within one who is connected with their own divine aspect—whose body is not a thing unto itself, and whose soul is not a thing unto itself, like two neighbors who happen to live in the same house but who are nevertheless separate and distant from one another. Rather, the body must desire to be a servant of the spirit, to follow the activation of the soul—and not simply follow its own whims. Then, when one comes to pray, the Holy Blessed Ones prays too, as we have described.",
        "2_Holidays, 1_Shabbat Teshuvah, 3_Chapter, 6_Paragraph": "“From the depths I called to you, YHVH.” It is as if to say, ‘My words are not words of prayer, but rather, My own depths cry out.’ And this is hinted at: “Just as you see me wrapped in a tallit and calling out the 13 attributes, you must teach Israel to do the same—” that they should make it so that I am calling out and praying through them.\n"
